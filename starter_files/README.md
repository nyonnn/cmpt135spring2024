- [makefile](makefile) is the standard generic course makefile for compiling
  programs.
- [hello_world.cpp](starter_files/hello_world.cpp) is a simple C++ program that
  you can use to test if your compiler is working. It's also a good starting
  point for your first assignment.
- [cmpt_error.h](starter_files/cmpt_error.h) is a header file that provides the
  function `cmpt135::error(msg)`. You call this when you intentionally want your
  program to end due to an error.
- [cmpt_trace.h](starter_files/cmpt_trace.h) and
  [cmpt_trace.cpp](starter_files/cmpt_trace.cpp) provide simple function-tracing
  for C++ function calls.
- [test.h](starter_files/test.h) is a helper file for writing unit tests.
