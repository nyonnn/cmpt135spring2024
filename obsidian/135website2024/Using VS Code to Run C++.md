In class I use a Windows laptop running [[WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux|WSL]] and [VS Code text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Both are free and quite popular, and they work well together.

To use the same setup, do the following:
1. Follow these steps for installing [[WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux|WSL]].
2. Download and install the [VS Code text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. [Get VS Code working with WSL](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).
4. [In VS Code install C++ plugins to make development easier](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).
	-  compile and run all C++ programs in the WSL terminal command-line in VS Code. I do not use VS Code's compiling tools.
5. Install g++ and related tools by opening a WSL terminal in VS Code and following the instruction in [[Getting Your C++ Environment Up and Running]].
