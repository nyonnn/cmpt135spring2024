nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
'An if a man did need a poison now,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
'Farewell:'
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
'Fore your own eyes and ears?
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.
'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
'I am yours for ever.'
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
'O, farewell, Warwick!'
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
'Remember now my brother.'
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
'Save your honour!
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
'Shall'!
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
'That I receive the general food at first,
'Then music with her silver sound
'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
'This general applause and loving shout
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
'This we received;' and each in either side
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
'Thou shalt not steal'?
'Though all at once cannot
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
'Tis Aufidius,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.
'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
'Tis a villain, sir,
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
'Tis best thou diest quickly.
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
'Tis better using France than trusting France:
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
'Tis death for any one in Mantua
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
'Tis done, my gracious lord.
'Tis done.
'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
'Tis false.
'Tis far off
'Tis figured in my tongue.
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
'Tis grace indeed.
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
'Tis more than you deserve;
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
'Tis most like he will.
'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
'Tis none of mine.
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
'Tis not possible.
'Tis not the devil's crest.
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
'Tis now near night.
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
'Tis past enduring.
'Tis pity of him.
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
'Tis right.
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
'Tis the way
'Tis this slave;--
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
'Tis time
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
'Tis true:
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
'Tis warm at 's heart.
'Tis well borne up.
'Tis well that thou hast cause
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
'Tis with cares.
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
'Twas by rebellion against his king.
'Twas from the canon.
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
'Twas you we laughed at.
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
'Twere good he were school'd.
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
'Twere well
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
'Zounds! who is there?
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the

'lady, lady, lady.'

A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A beggar, brother?
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A bird that will revenge upon you all:
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
A boy?
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A brand to the end o' the world.
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
A brittle glory shineth in this face:
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A callat
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A cause more promising
A challenge, on my life.
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A crack, madam.
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A daughter, and a goodly babe,
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A dire induction am I witness to,
A dish that I do love to feed upon.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
A dollar.
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A dozen years; within which space she died
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
A falsehood in its contrary as great
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
A federary with her, and one that knows
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A fortnight and odd days.
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
A gentleman of noble parentage,
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
A gentleman.
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
A god on earth thou art.
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
A good demand.
A good direction, warlike sovereign.
A good swift simile, but something currish.
A goodly city is this Antium. City,
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
A grandam's name is little less in love
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
A greater power than we can contradict
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
A gross hag
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
A horse and a man
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
A human shape.
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
A hundred then.
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
A husband! a devil.
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
A join'd-stool.
A just and open trial. While she lives
A kinder value of the people than
A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
A lady like me, with a love even such,
A laughter.
A league below the city; and from thence,
A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
A lightning before death: O, how may I
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
A little fire is quickly trodden out;
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
A little little grave, an obscure grave;
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
A lunatic lean-witted fool,
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
A man already made, as to remit
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A man of their infirmity.
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A man, as you are.
A man, the worst about you.
A man, young lady! lady, such a man
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
A marble monument!
A mark so bloody on the business, but
A marvellous poor one.
A match!
A match! 'tis done.
A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A merriment than a vice.
A merry heart goes all the day,
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
A miserable by the death of him
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A most courteous exposition.
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A most inherent baseness.
A most intelligencing bawd!
A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A nest of traitors!
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
A noble fellow, I warrant him.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A noble servant to them; but he could not
A noble wish.
A novice of this place and the fair sister
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
A pair of stocks, you rogue!
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
A parasite, a keeper back of death,
A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A party in this alteration, finding
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A place below the first: for what miscarries
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
A place whereto you'll go?
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
A plot shall show us all a merry day.
A pond as deep as hell.
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
A pretty peat! it is best
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
A prince of power.
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
A proper stripling and an amorous!
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
A rhyme I learn'd even now
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
A royal battle might be won and lost
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
A sail, a sail!
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A second course of fight.
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A servant grafted in my serious trust
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
A shepherd's daughter,
A shepherd's daughter.
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
A sure destruction.
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
A thing divine, for nothing natural
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
A thousand times good night!
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
A thriving issue: there is no lady living
A time before we came unto this cell?
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
A traitor to his God, his king and him;
A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
A very mean meaning.
A very scurvy fellow.
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A villain that is hither come in spite,
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
A visor for a visor! what care I
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A warrant for his execution.
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
A widow, then?
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
A witty mother! witless else her son.
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
A woman's general; what should we fear?
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
A woman.
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
A' shall not tread on me;
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
Abated captives to some nation
Abbot:
Abbot:
Abhorred slave,
Abides in me; I say amen to all.
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
About it; for it stands me much upon,
About some gossips for your highness.
About that which concerns your grace and us;
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
About their functions friendly.
About what?
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Above an hour, my lord.
Above the border of this horizon,
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Accept my thankfulness.
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
According to the fashion and the time.
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
Account me not your servant.
Accountant to the law upon that pain.
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
Add an immortal title to your crown!
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
Added to their familiarity,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
Adding withal how blest this land would be
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
Adieu, good neighbour.
Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
Adieu, sir.
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
Admit no other way to save his life,--
Adonis painted by a running brook,
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
Advance our standards, set upon our foes
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
Advantaging their loan with interest
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
Advertising and holy to your business,
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
Affection is not rated from the heart:
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
Affliction alters.
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Affront his eye.
Afore me! it is so very very late,
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
After I have done what I promised?
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
After his studies or his usual pain?
After my death the one half of my lands,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
After our sentence plaining comes too late.
After the battle let George Stanley die.
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
After the inveterate hate he bears you.
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
After the prompter, for our entrance:
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Again shall you be mother to a king,
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Against all noble sufferance.
Against all sense you do importune her:
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Against infection and the hand of war,
Against my brother's life.
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
Against my will to do myself this wrong.
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Against the envy of less happier lands,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
Against the rectorship of judgment?
Against the state and profit of this land;
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
Against the word:
Against their will. But who comes here?
Against them both my true joints bended be.
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Against thy entrance.
Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Against us brats, with no less confidence
Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:
Against what should ensue.
Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
Aged sir, hands off.
Agreed.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
Ah! and did they so?
Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
Ah, Exeter!
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
Ah, know you not the city favours them,
Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!
Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
Alack, and what shall good old York there see
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
Alack, for mercy!
Alack, for pity!
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Alack, what trouble
Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
Alas! what poor ability's in me
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
Alas, alas!
Alas, alas!
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
Alas, how can we for our country pray.
Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
Alas, poor soul!
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
All Citizens:
All Conspirators:
All Conspirators:
All The Lords:
All The People:
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
All books of love, see that at any hand;
All but the base.
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
All circumstances well considered.
All comfort that the dark night can afford
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
All hail, my sovereign liege!
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
All men, I hope, live so.
All mine own folly--the society,
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
All must be even in our government.
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
All places that the eye of heaven visits
All places yield to him ere he sits down;
All points of my command.
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
All several sins, all used in each degree,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
All that you speak shows fair.
All the contagion of the south light on you,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All things in common nature should produce
All things is ready. How near is our master?
All things that we ordained festival,
All this I know; and to the marriage
All this divided York and Lancaster,
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
All this is true.
All this we swear.
All to the senate-house: some news is come
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
All tongues to talk their bitterest.
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
All will be naught else.
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
All's well; and might have been much better, if
All-hallond eve.

Alla stoccata carries it away.
Allaying both their fury and my passion
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
Allow their officers and are content
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
Almost at point to enter.
Alone I did it. Boy!
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
Although I think 'twas in another sense;
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
Although by confiscation they are ours,
Although the print be little, the whole matter
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
Always obedient to your grace's will,
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
Am I like such a fellow?
Am I not wise?
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
Am heir to my affection.
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
Amen!
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
Amen, amen.
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Among them know you one Vincentio?
Amongst much other talk, that very time,
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
Amongst your cloven army.
An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
An I might live to see thee married once,
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
An affable and courteous gentleman:
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
An angry arm against His minister.
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
An easy task it is to win our own.
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
An evident calamity, though we had
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
An he had been cannibally given, he might have
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
An hour before I came, the duchess died.
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
An if I do not, may my hands rot off
An if I live until I be a man,
An if he may, then am I lawful king;
An if my word be sterling yet in England,
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
An it had not fallen flat-long.
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
An oath is of no moment, being not took
An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
An old hare hoar,
An onion will do well for such a shift,
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
An outward honour for an inward toil;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
An you re us and fa us, you note us.
An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
An't please your honour, players
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
And  
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
And 'twere the cheaper way:
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
And He that might the vantage best have took
And Henry but usurps the diadem.
And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
And I am come to seek that name in England;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
And I am going with instruction to him.
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
And I am one that love Bianca more
And I am proof against their enmity.
And I am ready to put armour on.
And I am ready to put armour on.'
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
And I am tied to be obedient;
And I believe twill never stand upright
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
And I choose Clarence only for protector.
And I confess besides I am no maid:
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
And I do hope good days and long to see.
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
And I for my escape have put on his;
And I for winking at your discords too
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
And I had rather glib myself than they
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
And I in all unwillingness will go.
And I in better state than e'er I was.
And I must find that title in your tongue,
And I myself secure in grace and favour.
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And I shall.
And I the house of York.
And I the rather wean me from despair
And I this.
And I to Norfolk with my followers.
And I unjustly too, must grant it you
And I unto the sea from whence I came.
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
And I will pamper it with lamentations.
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
And I wish, my liege,
And I with tears do wash the blood away.
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
And I'll believe thee.
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
And I'll not wish thee to her.
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
And I'll say nothing.
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
And I, my lord, will bear him company.
And I, that haply take them from him now,
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
And I, to keep all this.
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
And I, who at his hands received my life, him
And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
And Montague our topmost; what of him?
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
And Somerset another goodly mast?
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
And a half, sir.
And a petition granted them, a strange one--
And added years to his short banishment,
And affecting one sole throne,
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
And after that trust to thee.
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
And all combined, save what thou must combine
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
And all my armour laid into my tent?
And all my followers to the eager foe
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
And all probation will make up full clear,
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
And all the better is it for the maid:
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
And all the devils are here.'
And all the household servants fled with him
And all the number of his fair demands
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
And all the rest o' the fleet.
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
And all the ruins of distressful times
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
And all their ministers attend on him.
And all things answerable to this portion.
And all things change them to the contrary.
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
And all those friends that deign to follow me.
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
And all your northern castles yielded up,
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st
And am I then a man to be beloved?
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
And an old hare hoar,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
And as the air blows it to me again,
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
And at the other is my servant Catesby
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And bad'st me bury love.
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
And barbarism itself have pitied him.
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
And be a happy mother by the deed.
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
And be inheritor of thy desire.
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
And be not easily won to our request:
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
And be you silent and attentive too,
And bear him to the rock.
And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
And bear the sow-skin budget,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
And beat the messenger who bids beware
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
And begin, 'Why to me?'
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
And being seated, and domestic broils
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
And blindfold death not let me see my son.
And blister you all o'er!
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
And blow it to the source from whence it came:
And blown with restless violence round about
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
And both are ready in their offices,
And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'
And both return back to their chairs again:
And both the princes had been breathing here,
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
And bow my knee before his majesty:
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
And bring away the armour that is there.
And bring him up to liking.
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
And bring thy news so late?
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
And brought desired help from Burgundy:
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
And buried once, why not upon my head?
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
And but attended by a simple guard,
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
And by an eminent body that enforced
And by and by my master drew on him;
And by good fortune I have lighted well
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
And by his rare example made the coward
And by my body's action teach my mind
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
And by the bright track of his fiery car,
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
And by the honourable tomb he swears,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
And by the royalties of both your bloods,
And by the second hour in the morning
And by the worth and honour of himself,
And by their vehement instigation,
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
And call him noble that was now your hate,
And call me father? better burn it now
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
And came I not at last to comfort you?
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
And cannot lose your way.
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
And charges him my lord, with such a time
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
And cloister thee in some religious house:
And come again to me; who, on my life,
And come now to create you Duke of York.
And come some other time to know our mind.
And come to Padua, careless of your life?
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
And could not get him for my heart to do it.
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
And craves your company for speedy counsel.
And credulous to false prints.
And creep into it far before thy time?
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
And curse that justice did it.
And daily new exactions are devised,
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
And dares him to set forward to the fight.
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
And darts his light through every guilty hole,
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And descant on mine own deformity:
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
And disinherited thine only son.
And dispossessing all my other parts
And do as adversaries do in law,
And do expect him here some two hours hence.
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
And do my spiriting gently.
And do not call them bastards.
And do not interrupt me in my course.
And do not say 'tis superstition, that
And do thee favours with my royal hands.
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
And durst not once peep out.
And duty bids defend; the other again
And each one to his office when he wakes.
And egally indeed to all estates,--
And either victory, or else a grave.
And entertain a cheerful disposition.
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
And even here brake off, and came away.
And every day I cannot come to woo.
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
And every hour more competitors
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
And every thing is left at six and seven.
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And executing the outward face of royalty,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
And fawn on rage with base humility,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
And fearfully did menace me with death,
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
And fight and die is death destroying death;
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
And follow Marcius.
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
And follow to thine answer.
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
And for I know she taketh most delight
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
And for because the world is populous
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
And for my sister and her princely sons,
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
And for that name which is no part of thee
And for that offence
And for the love he beareth to your daughter
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
And for this once my will shall stand for law.
And for thy maintenance commits his body
And for we think the eagle-winged pride
And for your brother, he was lately sent
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
And formally, according to our law,
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
And frame my face to all occasions.
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
And free access and favour as the rest:
And free from other misbegotten hate,
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
And from her womb children of divers kind
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
And from my soul too;
And from that torment I will free myself,
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
And from this testimony of your own sex,--
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
And frown upon 's.
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
And future ages groan for this foul act;
And gape at widest to glut him.
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
And gave him graceful posture.
And gave him what becomed love I might,
And general honour.
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
And give him from me this most needful scroll.
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
And give me leave,
And give more strength to that which hath too much,
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
And give them friendly welcome every one:
And give them leave to fly that will not stay;
And give us notice of his inclination:
And give't me in mine ear.
And given his deputation all the organs
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
And given unto the house of York such head
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
And good supporters are you.
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
And gracious be the issue!
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
And grieve to hear't.
And had he match'd according to his state,
And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
And had the tribute of his supple knee,
And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
And handed love as you do, I was wont
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
And happily I have arrived at the last
And happily we might be interrupted.
And happy always was it for that son
And hardening of my brows.
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
And harsh in sound to thine.
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
And haste is needful in this desperate case.
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
And have no vigour in them.
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
And have you nuns no farther privileges?
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
And he himself wander'd away alone,
And he knew my deceased father well.
And he may fetch him.
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
And he our subjects' next degree in hope.
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
And he shall feel mine edge.
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
And he shall signify from time to time
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
And he that hath commanded is the king.
And he that slew them fouler than he is:
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
And he that will not fight for such a hope.
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
And he whose wife is most obedient
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
And he would love me dearly as his child.
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
And he, and more
And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
And hear your mother's lamentation!
And hearten those that fight in your defence:
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
And help the joy.
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
And her immortal part with angels lives.
And her withholds from me and other more,
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
And here comes Claudio's pardon.
And here have I the daintiness of ear
And here he comes.
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
And here is come to do some villanous shame
And here is not a creature but myself,
And here receive we from our father Stanley
And here remain with your uncertainty!
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
And hide the false seems true.
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
And his brave son being twain.
And his contract by deputy in France;
And his enforcement of the city wives;
And his great person perish.
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
And his offence is so, as it appears,
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
And his physicians fear him mightily.
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
And his to me:
And his well-chosen bride.
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
And hither shall he come: and he and I
And hold you ever to our special drift;
And hope to joy is little less in joy
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
And how shall we continue Claudio,
And how she was beguiled and surprised,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
And hug it in mine arms.
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
And if King Edward be as true and just
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
And in Apollos name, his oracle.
And in compassion weep the fire out;
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
And in conclusion wins the king from her,
And in devotion spend my latter days,
And in her most unmitigable rage,
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
And in that quarrel use it to the death.
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
And in the stocks avouch it.
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
And in the towns, as they do march along,
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
And in the witness of his proper ear,
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
And in this covert will we make our stand,
And in this resolution here we leave you.--
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
And in this state she gallops night by night
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;
And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
And interchangeably set down their hands,
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
And is this all?
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
And it I will have, or I will have none.
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
And keep their teeth clean.
And keep your honours safe!
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
And kingly government of this your land,
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
And knew no other kin.
And know how we proceed.
And know not now what name to call myself!
And know their spring, their head, their
And laboured all I could to do him right;
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
And lands restored again be freely granted:
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
And lastly, to confirm that amity
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
And lay those honours on your high deserts.
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.
And learn to make a body of a limb.
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
And leave you naked.
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
And left thee but a very prey to time;
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
And left them
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
And let Bianca take her sister's room.
And let go by the actor.
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
And let his manly face, which promiseth
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
And let me have them very well perfumed
And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
And let mischance be slave to patience.
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
And let the subject see, to make them know
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
And let them die that age and sullens have;
And let them work. The nature of our people,
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
And let's be red with mirth.
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.
And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
And list what with our council we have done.
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
And little look'd for at your helping hands.
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
And live you yet?
And lived by looking on his images:
And living too; for now his son is duke.
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
And long hereafter say unto his child,
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
And look upon, as if the tragedy
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
And look'd upon things precious as they were
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
And loving farewell of our several friends.
And made Verona's ancient citizens
And made a preachment of your high descent?
And made an evening at the noontide prick.
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
And made her widow to a woful bed?
And made him to resign his crown perforce.
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
And made our footstool of security.
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And make a dearth in this revolting land.
And make assurance here in Padua
And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
And make high majesty look like itself,
And make him of like spirit to himself.
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
And make me happy in your unity.
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
And make thy weapon drop.
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
And make us lose the good we oft might win
And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,
And make your channel his? If he have power
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
And makes a god of such a cullion:
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
And makes himself an artificial night:
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
And many a man there is, even at this present,
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
And many giddy people flock to him.
And many more of noble fame and worth:
And many strokes, though with a little axe,
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
And may direct his course as please himself,
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And may not young men die, as well as old?
And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
And me too, good Lord!
And mean to make her queen of England.
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
And meet me presently at Berkeley.
And meet me presently at Salisbury.
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
And merrily hent the stile-a:
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
And minister correction to thy fault!
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
And most assured that he is a friend
And most chirurgeonly.
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
And most opportune to our need I have
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
And mothers that lack sons.
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
And much I need to help you, if need were;
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
And must be buried but as an intent
And must she die for this? O, let her live,
And must we be divided? must we part?
And my large kingdom for a little grave,
And my pretext to strike at him admits
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
And neither by treason nor hostility
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
And never borrow any tear of thee.
And never brandish more revengeful steel
And never from this palace of dim night
And never in my life, I do protest,
And never look upon thy face again.
And never see day that the happy sees,
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
And never show thy head by day nor light.
And never to my red-look'd anger be
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
And never will I rise up from the ground
And never will I undertake the thing
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
And no worldly suit would he be moved,
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
And none contented: sometimes am I king;
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
And not against his friends; his noble hand
And not be Richard that hath done all this.
And not be tied unto his brother's will.
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
And not impute this yielding to light love,
And not in me: I am myself alone.
And not my brother.
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
And not obedient to his honest will,
And not our streets with war!
And not provoked by any suitor else;
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
And not till then.
And not unluckily against the bias.
And not with such a cruel threatening look.
And nothing can we call our own but death
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
And nothing of your answer.
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
And now I find report a very liar;
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
And now my tongue's use is to me no more
And now to London all the crew are gone,
And now to London with triumphant march,
And now what rests but that we spend the time
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
And now will I be Edward's champion.
And now you know my meaning,
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
And occupations perish!
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
And of their feather many more proud birds,
And offer me disguised in sober robes
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
And once again proclaim us King of England.
And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.
And one whom much I honour.
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
And only in that safety died her brothers.
And only live by gazing.
And only that I stand for. I appeal
And orphans for their parents timeless death--
And ostentation of despised arms?
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
And over-shine the earth as this the world.
And overmuch consumed his royal person:
And own no other function: each your doing,
And paint your face and use you like a fool.
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
And pardon us the interruption
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
And part in just proportion our small strength.
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
And pass'd him unelected.
And patient fools,
And patient underbearing of his fortune,
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
And pay them when you part.
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
And perform an old contracting.
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
And place your hands below your husband's foot:
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
And power i' the truth o' the cause.
And power, unto itself most commendable,
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
And pray that I may repossess the crown.
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
And presently took post to tell it you:
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
And princess no worse issued.
And private in his chamber pens himself,
And promise them success and victory.
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
And pull'd the law upon you.
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
And put on sullen black incontinent:
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
And quietness of the people, which before
And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
And rack thee in their fancies.
And rail upon the hostess of the house;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
And rather like a dream than an assurance
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
And rather than it shall, I will be free
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And rear it in the place your father's stands.
And reason coldly of your grievances,
And reason too:
And replant Henry in his former state.
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
And sack great Rome with Romans.
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
And saving those that eye thee!
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
And say it is the queen and her allies
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
And say what thou seest yond.
And say you would present her at the leet,
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
And says a wizard told him that by G
And says that once more I shall interchange
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
And see another, as I see thee now,
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
And see him seated in the regal throne.
And see how he will take it at your hands.
And see how one another lends content
And see it instantly consumed with fire;
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
And see our pleasure herein executed.
And see what death is doing.
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
And see you read no other lectures to her:
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
And seized upon their towns and provinces.
And send him many years of sunshine days!
And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
And send them after to supply our wants;
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
And sent according to command; whiles I
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
And set thy diadem upon my head;
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
And shall I have?
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
And shall have your will, because our king:
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
And shamed life a hateful.
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
And she as much in love, her means much less
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
And she can have no more than all I have:
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
And she to him, to stay him not too long,
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
And ship from thence to Flanders.
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
And show fair duty to his majesty.
And show more sign of her obedience,
And show no sign of fear.
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
And since that time it is eleven years;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
And sit thee by our side:
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
And six or seven winters more respect
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
And slept above some fifteen year or more.
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
And so I am: then crushing penury
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
And so I was; which plainly signified
And so am come abroad to see the world.
And so are like to do.
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
And so deliver, I am put to sea
And so did I.
And so did I.
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
And so have I, boy.
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
And so it shall be so for Katharina.
And so most joyfully we take our leave.
And so obsequious will thy father be,
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
And so once more return and tell his grace.
And so say I.
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
And so swear I, my lord
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
And so was I: I'll bear you company.
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
And so we will, provided that he win her.
And so will I.
And so your follies fight against yourself.
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
And so, have at thee!
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And soar with them above a common bound.
And some few vanities that make him light;
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
And soundly too: your houses!
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
And speak his very heart.
And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
And spur thee on with full as many lies
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
And stand upon my common part with those
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
And state of bodies would bewray what life
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
And still is friend to him and Margaret:
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
And still to nose the offence.
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
And stole into the covert of the wood:
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
And stops he now for breath?
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
And strays about to find 'em.
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
And take a lodging fit to entertain
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
And take her hence in horror.
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
And take the shame with joy.
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
And takest it all for jest.
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
And tapers burn'd to bedward!
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
And tell 's a tale.
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
And tell him privily of our intent.
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
And tells us, what occasion of import
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
And that a winged Mercury did bear:
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
And that his bags shall prove.
And that his country's dearer than himself;
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
And that is more than I will yield unto:
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
And that may be determined at the one
And that my fortune rubs against the bias.
And that my master slew him.
And that my path were even to the crown,
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
And that small model of the barren earth
And that so lamely and unfashionable
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
And that the people of this blessed land
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
And that to the infection of my brains
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
And that we have a curse in having her:
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
And that you not delay the present, but,
And that you will some good instruction give
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
And that's the wavering commons: for their love
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
And the beholders of this tragic play,
And the buildings of my fancy: only
And the compact is firm and true in me.
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
And the desire of the nobles.
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
And the gods doom him after!
And the moon changes even as your mind.
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
And the most noble mother of the world
And the new deputy now for the duke--
And the nobility of Rome are his:
And the place death, considering who thou art,
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
And the rank poison of the old will die.
And the rarest that e'er came there.
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
And then I came away.
And then I know after who comes by the worst.
And then I ran away to call the watch.
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
And then I'll set upon him.
And then I'll speak a little.
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
And then be gone and trouble you no more.
And then begin again, and stop again,
And then betwixt me and my married wife.
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And then down falls again.
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And then he sends you word
And then hurl down their indignation
And then in post he came from Mantua
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
And then return lamenting to my love.
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
And then take hands:
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
And then to crave a league of amity;
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
And then will I be general of your woes,
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
And then?
And then?
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
And there I stood amazed for a while,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
And there present yourself and your fair princess,
And there receive her approbation:
And there repose you for this night.
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
And there the little souls of Edward's children
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
And there's for twitting me with perjury.
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
And therefore is he idle?
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
And therefore level not to hit their lives.
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
And therefore, personally I lay my claim
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
And therein negligent; or else a fool
And therein show'd like enemies.
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
And these external manners of laments
And these same thoughts people this little world,
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
And they to him are angels.
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
And think upon my bidding.
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
And this is he was his adopted heir.
And this my neighbour too?
And this same needy man must sell it me.
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
And those but mean.
And those his golden beams to you here lent
And those that bear them living.
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
And those who have the wit to claim the place:
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
And thou art wedded to calamity.
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
And thou unfit for any place but hell.
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
And though you think that all, as you have done,
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
And three examples of the like have been
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
And through him what is nearest to him, which is
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
And throw their power i' the dust.
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
And thus I clothe my naked villany
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
And thus my battle shall be ordered:
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
And thy no greater father.
And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
And till I root out their accursed line
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
And time it is, when raging war is done,
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
And to be boy eternal.
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
And to give notice, that no manner of person
And to make us no better thought of, a little help
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
And to my humble seat conform myself.
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And to myself become an enemy.
And to repair my honour lost for him,
And to set on this wretched woman here
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.
And to transport him in the mind he is
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
And topping all others in boasting.
And towards London they do bend their course,
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
And tread upon his neck.
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
And trouble not the peace.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
And twenty more such names and men as these
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
And unavoided is the danger now,
And undertake the teaching of the maid:
And unrespective boys: none are for me
And unsuspected court her by herself.
And urged it twice together, did he not?
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
And usest none in that true use indeed
And utter ruin of the house of York.
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.
And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
And very well appointed, as I thought,
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
And vows revenge as spacious as between
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
And watch our vantage in this business:
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
And watch your safety.
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
And water cannot wash away your sin.
And we are barren and bereft of friends;
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.
And we create, in absence of ourself,
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
And we in them no hope to win the day;
And we may soon our satisfaction have
And we mean well in going to this mask;
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
And we their hands.
And we will both together to the Tower,
And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
And we, in pity of the gentle king,
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.
And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
And wear it as a favour; and with that
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
And well she can persuade.
And well we may come there by dinner-time.
And were I any thing but what I am,
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
And were his daughter fairer than she is,
And were the king on't, what would I do?
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And what God will, that let your king perform;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
And what I want it boots not to complain.
And what a prisoner.
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
And what is left, to lose it by his country,
And what loss is it to be rid of care?
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
And what of all this?
And what of him, Tranio?
And what of him?
And what said the gallant?
And what shall become of those in the city?
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
And what to?
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
And when I give occasion of offence,
And when I have my meed, I must away;
And when I mount, alive may I not light,
And when I wander here and there,
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
And when in music we have spent an hour,
And when mine oratory grew to an end
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And when such time they have begun to cry,
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
And when the king comes, offer no violence,
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
And where the worser is predominant,
And where two raging fires meet together
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
And why not queen?
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
And why so, my lord?
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
And will deny him:
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
And will not promise her to any man
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
And wilt thou learn of me?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
And with a low submissive reverence
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
And with a sudden reinforcement struck
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
And with all speed post with him toward the north,
And with declining head into his bosom,
And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
And with full line of his authority,
And with her breath she did perfume the air:
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
And with his charity slain.
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
And with his troops doth march amain to London;
And with his varying childness cures in me
And with my child my joys are buried.
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
And with the deepest malice of the war
And with the other fling it at thy face,
And with their helps only defend ourselves;
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
And witness of the malice and displeasure
And women too, but innocent and pure;
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
And world's exile is death: then banished,
And would by combat make her good, so were I
And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
And would my father had left me no more!
And would you not do much to do them good?
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
And yet I come not well.
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
And yet I love him.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
And yet I would it were to give again.
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
And yet go current from suspicion!
And yet his punishment was cruel death.
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
And yet my nature never in the fight
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
And yet not many.
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
And yet salt water blinds them not so much
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
And yet she is inferior to none.
And yet so fast asleep.
And yet the king not privy to my drift,
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
And yet too good to be your concubine.
And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
And yet we should, for perpetuity,
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
And yet you halt not.
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
And yielding to another when it blows,
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
And you but waste your words.
And you can witness with me this is true.
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
And you shall be conducted.
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
And you shall pay well for 'em.
And you shall understand from me her mind.
And you shall well be spared.
And you tell me that he shall die for it.
And you that do abet him in this kind
And you the mutinous members; for examine
And you the queen on't.
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
And you will rather show our general louts
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
And you, good brother father. What offence hath
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
And you, sir! you are welcome.
And you.
And you.
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
And, Norfolk, throw down his.
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.
And, as I further have to understand,
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
And, as we march, our strength will be augmented
And, being a winner, God give you good night!
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
And, being angry, does forget that ever
And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
And, by just computation of the time,
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?
And, daughter, yours.
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
And, for my name of George begins with G,
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
And, for the good report I hear of you
And, for the most, become much more the better
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
And, for this night, we'll fast for company:
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
And, for unfelt imagination,
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
And, honest company, I thank you all,
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
And, let your father make her the assurance,
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
And, like a traitor to the name of God,
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
And, madam,
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
And, mutually participate, did minister
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
And, often but attended with weak guard,
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.
And, though mine enemy, restored again
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
And, till so much blood thither come again,
And, to be noted for a merry man,
And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
And, toward the education of your daughters,
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
And,--do you mark me, sir?
Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
Angelo,
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
Anon do meet the senate.
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
Anon!
Anon!
Anon, anon!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
Another dowry to another daughter,
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
Another way I have to man my haggard,
Another's issue.
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
Answer to us.
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
Antonio, my father, is deceased;
Antony, and Potpan!
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Any silk, any thread,
Any thing, my lord,
Any toys for your head,
Apollo be my judge!
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Apollo, pardon
Apothecary:
Apothecary:
Apothecary:
Apothecary:
Apparent to my heart.
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
Appear in person here in court. Silence!
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
Appear not like a guest.
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
Appointed to direct these fair designs.
Apprehend
Approach, my Ariel, come.
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Are all things fitting for that royal time?
Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
Are bound to pray for you both.
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
Are come from visiting his majesty.
Are come to have some conference with his grace.
Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
Are daily given to ennoble those
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
Are making hither with all due expedience
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
Are not these large enough?
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Are now to have no successive degrees,
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
Are servanted to others: though I owe
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
Are suitors to you.
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
Are there no other tokens
Are these your herd?
Are they not now upon the western shore.
Are they returned to the court?
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
Are you a maid?
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
Are you agreed?
Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
Are you content to stay?
Are you contented to resign the crown?
Are you in earnest, sir?
Are you mankind?
Are you moved, my lord?
Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
Ariel and all his quality.
Ariel, thy charge
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
Art thou his father?
Art thou my calf?
Art thou my son?
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
Art thou sure of this?
Art thou, indeed?
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
As Hercules
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
As I am now unhappy; which is more
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
As I before unparted to your worship,
As I bethink me, you should not be king
As I by friends am well advertised,
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
As I come out: this action I now go on
As I could pick my lance.
As I did him, and speak of something wildly
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
As I do pray the gods.
As I do think, to-morrow.
As I guess, Marcius,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
As I had title in thy noble husband!
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
As I intend more good to you and yours,
As I intend to prosper and repent,
As I intend to thrive in this new world,
As I intended, for it wrought on her
As I remember, Henry the Sixth
As I remember, this should be the house.
As I seem now. Their transformations
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
As I wish you were.
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
As a long-parted mother with her child
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
As any in Vienna, on my word.
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
As are of better person than myself,
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
As art and practise hath enriched any
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
As being got, your father then in France,
As being well content with that alone.
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
As blameful as the executioner?
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
As brittle as the glory is the face;
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
As certain as I know the sun is fire:
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
As closely to conceal what we impart:
As confident as is the falcon's flight
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
As deep as that, though true.
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
As doth the blushing discontented sun
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
As e'er I heard in madness.
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
As enemy to the people and his country:
As ever in ambitious strength I did
As ever oak or stone was sound.
As every loyal subject ought to do.
As every present time doth boast itself
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
As far as land will let me, by your side.
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
As firmly as yourself were still in place:
As for another secret close intent,
As for my country I have shed my blood,
As for my patron, stand you so assured,
As for the brat of this accursed duke,
As frankly as a pin.
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
As full of valour as of royal blood:
As gentle and as jocund as to jest
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
As had she studied to misuse me so.
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
As he began, and not unknit himself
As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
As he forth walked on his way:--
As he from heaven merits it, with you
As he had lost some province and a region
As he had seen't or been an instrument
As he hath followed you, with all despite;
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
As he is but my father's brother's son,
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
As he is proud to do't.
As he shall think by our true diligence
As he was coming from this churchyard side.
As he will lose his head ere give consent
As he's reported by this gentleman;
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As if I did but only chew his name;
As if I had received them for the hire
As if I loved my little should be dieted
As if Olympus to a molehill should
As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
As if a man were author of himself
As if he did contemn what he requested
As if he were his officer: desperation
As if he were the right Vincentio
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
As if my brother lived: I partly think
As if that name,
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
As if the golden fee for which I plead
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
As if this flesh which walls about our life,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
As if you were a feasted one and not
As if you were a god to punish, not
As in a soul remembering my good friends;
As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
As is a winged messenger of heaven
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
As is the night before some festival
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
As is the other for beauteous modesty.
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
As it is here set down.
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
As like Hermione as is her picture,
As like almost to Claudio as himself.
As likely to be blest in peace and war;
As little joy may you suppose in me.
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
As lively painted as the deed was done.
As living here and you no use of him.
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
As long as you or I yet he must die.
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
As many as you please.
As many vouched rarities are.
As may appear by Edward's good success,
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
As may beseem a monarch like himself.
As mercy does.
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
As merry as you will.
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
As mine is to him?
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
As mine, against their will. Should all despair
As miserable by the life of thee
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
As much as in him lies, from time to time
As much for my poor brother as myself:
As much good stay with thee as go with me!
As much in mock as mark.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
As my Antigonus to break his grave
As my ripe revenue and due by birth
As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
As my true service shall deserve your love.
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
As now she might have done,
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
As often as we eat. By the elements,
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
As one unworthy all the former favours
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
As passes colouring.
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
As recompense of our dear services
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
As shall be proved upon you?
As shall become your highness; where you may
As shall revenge his death before I stir.
As shall with either part's agreement stand?
As she from one ungot.
As she lived now.
As she lived peerless,
As she that he hath stain'd?
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
As surely as I live, my lord.
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
As the Antipodes are unto us,
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
As the most noble corse that ever herald
As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.
As then the messenger,--
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
As therefore kept to do so.
As they themselves would owe them.
As they us to our trenches followed.
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
As this world goes, to pass for honest.
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
As thou art tender to't.
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
As thou hast power and person.
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
As though she bid me stay by her a week:
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
As to be cast forth in the common air,
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
As to put metal in restrained means
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
As traitors do.
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
As victors wear at the Olympian games:
As violently as hasty powder fired
As was your former; but she shall be such
As we are mock'd with art.
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
As we this garden! We at time of year
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
As well I tender you and all of yours!
As well appeareth by the cause you come;
As well as I had seen and heard him speak
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
As well as one so great and so forlorn
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
As well assured Richard their king is dead.
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
As well we know your tenderness of heart
As were our England in reversion his,
As when a giant dies.
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
As will disperse itself through all the veins
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
As with a man busied about decrees:
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
As with a saint.
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
As words to little purpose.
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
As you have been; that's for my country:
As you have done; that's what I can; induced
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
As you intended well.
As you malign our senators for that
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
As you would beg, were you in my distress
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
As your good flock shall prosper.
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
Assay the power you have.
Assemble presently the people hither;
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
Associated with Aufidius, rages
At Antium lives he?
At Antium.
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
At Ely House.
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
At Ravenspurgh.
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
At an unusual hour?
At any time 'fore noon.
At any time have recourse unto the princes.
At any time, to grace my stratagems.
At each his needless heavings, such as you
At his house this night.
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
At knowing of thy choice.
At large discoursed in this paper here.
At last by notes of household harmony
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
At my depart, these were his very words:
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
At my poor house look to behold this night
At my request he would not.
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
At our more leisure shall I render you;
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
At some time when his soaring insolence
At that sad stop, my lord,
At the good queen's entreaty.
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
At the hour of nine.
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
At thy choice, then:
At thy good heart's oppression.
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
At war 'twixt will and will not.
At what hour to-morrow
At what o'clock to-morrow
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
Attend us through the city.
Attending but the signal to begin.
Attorney'd at your service.
Aufidius got off.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
Aumerle that was;
Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
Awaked you not with this sore agony?
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Away betimes, before his forces join,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
Away with her! Poor soul,
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
Away with him to death!
Away with him!
Away with him! and let her sport herself
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
Away with the joint-stools, remove the
Away!
Away!
Away! I say; commend me to thy master.
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
Away! get you away.
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.
Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.
Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Away, sir! you must go.
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
Awhile to work, and after holiday.
Ay me!
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
Ay, a thousand times.
Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
Ay, an it like your good worship.
Ay, and a kind one too:
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
Ay, and burn too.
Ay, and for an assault too.
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
Ay, and he'll tame her.
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Ay, and mine,
Ay, and more.
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
Ay, ay, the cords.
Ay, ay.
Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
Ay, boy, ready.
Ay, boy.
Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
Ay, but mildly.
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
Ay, but not mine own desire.
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
Ay, but the case is alter'd:
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
Ay, but why?
Ay, but yet
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
Ay, by and by;
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.
Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
Ay, forsooth.
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
Ay, my good lord.
Ay, my good lord.
Ay, my good lord.
Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
Ay, my lord: and fear
Ay, my lord;
Ay, my lord; even so
Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
Ay, sir, very well.
Ay, sir.
Ay, sir.
Ay, sir; a mystery
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
Ay, sir; well, well.
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--
Ay, so I did indeed.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Ay, so we will.
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
Ay, that Petruchio came.
Ay, that he razed.
Ay, that the king is dead.
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
Ay, there's the villany.
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
Ay, traitor, Marcius!
Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
Ay, what's o'clock?
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
Ay, with my heart
Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
Ay.
Ay.
Ay.
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
Ay; and you'll look pale
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so

Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
Banish us both and send the king with me.
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
Banished, sir.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
Barely in title, not in revenue.
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
Base men by his endowments are made great.
Base, fearful and despairing Henry!
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
Bastards and all.
Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Be absolute for death; either death or life
Be advised.
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
Be blamed for't how you might.
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.
Be born another such.
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
Be call'd your vanquisher.
Be calm, be calm.
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
Be collected:
Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
Be every man himself?
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Be executed in his father's sight.
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
Be gone;
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
Be his own carver and cut out his way,
Be hostages for Rome.
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
Be it as your wisdom will.
Be it forbid, my lord!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Be it with resolution then to fight.
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
Be known when 'tis brought forth.
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
Be merry, for our time of stay is short
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
Be not so hot; the duke
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
Be of comfort;
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
Be opposite all planets of good luck
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
Be perfect.
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
Be ready to direct these home alarms.
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
Be resident in men like one another
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
Be ruled by him.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Be stamp'd upon it.
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
Be swift like lightning in the execution;
Be taken from the people.
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
Be thus to them.
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Be you beneath the sky.
Be you content, fair maid;
Be you then as the people's officer.
Be-mock the modest moon.
Bear from hence his body;
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Bearing the king in my behalf along;
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Because I am the store-house and the shop
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
Because authority, though it err like others,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Because his fathers are more beautiful?
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
Because in quarrel of the house of York
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Because my name is George.
Because my power is weak and all ill left:
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
Because so well I love Lucentio.
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
Because that I am little, like an ape,
Because that now it lies you on to speak
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Because they have been still mine enemies:
Because thy father Henry did usurp;
Because we ever have been near the king.
Because we see it; but what we do not see
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
Become some women best, so that there be not
Become them with one half so good a grace
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
Been publicly accused, so shall she have
Before I be convict by course of law,
Before I freely speak my mind herein,
Before I have a husband for the elder:
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Before I make reply to aught you say.
Before I positively herein:
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Before I would have granted to that act.
Before King Richard in his royal lists?
Before a true and lawful magistrate,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
Before his sister should her body stoop
Before so noble and so great a figure
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
Before the common distribution, at
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Before the expiration of thy time,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Before the time be out? no more!
Before the times of change, still is it so:
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Before you find it other. All the regions
Before you had worn it out.
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Before-time seen him thus.
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Behold our human actions, as they do,
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Being criminal, in double violation
Being held a foe, he may not have access
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
Being ne'er so little urged, another way
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
Being once perfected how to grant suits,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being so great, I have no need to beg.
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Being the right idea of your father,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
Believe me, noble lord,
Believe me, on mine honour,
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
Benedicite!
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.
Beseech you, father.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
Beseech you,--
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
Besides I say and will in battle prove,
Besides himself, are all the English peers,
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
Besides, he says there are two councils held;
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
Besides, if things go well,
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
Besides, our nearness to the king in love
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Better it were a brother died at once,
Better it were they all came by the father,
Better once than never, for never too late.
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
Between the child and parent.
Between their births.
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
Bianca's grief.
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Bid her devise
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
Bid him not fear the separated councils
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
Bid me farewell.
Bid my guard watch; leave me.
Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
Bid them come near.
Bid them home:
Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
Bid them wash their faces
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Biondello, what of that?
Bishop of Exeter, his brother there,
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
Bless me from marrying a usurer!
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
Blessed be your royal grace!
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
Bliss and goodness on you!
Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
Blister'd be thy tongue
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Blue, my lord.
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;

Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Bolingbroke!'
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
Both Citizens:
Both Tribunes:
Both Tribunes:
Both Tribunes:
Both Tribunes:
Both by myself and many other friends:
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
Both disobedience and ingratitude
Both field and city ours, he never stood
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Both of one horse?
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
Both to defend himself and to approve
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
Both, both, my girl:
Both:
Both:
Both:

Bound by my charity and my blest order,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
Boy!

Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
Break too.
Break up the seals and read.
Breaking his oath and resolution like
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
Bred his hopes out of.
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
Bring forth these men.
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
Broke the possession of a royal bed
Broken his staff of office and dispersed
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
Brother, we done deeds of charity;
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Bum, sir.
Burn hotter than my faith.
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
Bushy, what news?
Business, my lord! I think most understand
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
But 'tis no wit to go.
But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
But 'twas ere I was born.
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
But I bethink me what a weary way
But I can give thee more:
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
But I fear
But I had rather kill two enemies.
But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
But I have reasons strong and forcible.
But I hear, no; they say my son of York
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
But I will have them, if I once know where.
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
But I will watch you from such watching now.
But I will write again to Mantua,
But I'ld say he had not,
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
But Montague is bound as well as I,
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
But O, thy wife!
But Romeo may not: more validity,
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
But a hare that is hoar
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
But after many ceremonies done,
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
But are they, Ariel, safe?
But art thou not advised, he took some care
But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
But as successively from blood to blood,
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
But as this title honours me and mine,
But as we stand in fear,--
But as you shake off one to take another;
But at this instant he is sick my lord,
But basely yielded upon compromise
But be it as it may: I here entail
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
But blessedly holp hither.
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
But by bad courses may be understood
But by fair sequence and succession?
But by his mother was perforce withheld.
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.
But by thy help to this distressed queen?
But by your voices, will not so permit me;
But can you, if you would?
But cannot make my heart consent to take
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
But certainly a maid.
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
But come, my lord, let us away.
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
But did I never speak of all that time?
But did you never swear, and break an oath?
But did you not request to have it cut?
But didst thou see them dead?
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
But doth suffer a sea-change
But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
But ere I last received the sacrament
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
But ever see that man!
But every man betake him to his legs.
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
But far unfit to be a sovereign.
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
But fetter you till death.
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
But few,
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
But for his own; and for the right of that
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
But for my brother not a man would speak,
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
But for the concord of my state and time
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
But for the sunset of my brother's son
But for thy world enjoying but this land,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
But from deceit bred by necessity;
But graciously to know I am no better.
But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
But he must die to-morrow?
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
But he's deceived; we are in readiness.
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
But hear you.
But hearts for the event.
But heaven hath a hand in these events,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
But here is Carlisle living, to abide
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
But how did you desire it should be made?
But how is it that great Plantagenet
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
But how or in what place I do not know.
But how prevail'd you?
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
But if an humble prayer may prevail,
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
But if you ever chance to have a child,
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
But if your title to the crown be weak,
But in all places else your master Lucentio.
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
But in the less foul profanation.
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
But in the night or in the time of war.
But in the other's silence do I see
But in the presence of the prioress:
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
But in this troublous time what's to be done?
But in what nature?
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
But instruments of some more mightier member
But is four Volsces? none of you but is
But is he gracious in the people's eye?
But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
But is there any?
But is this true, sir?
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
But kill'd itself much sooner.
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
But know not how it went. My second joy
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
But leave it all to God. whither away?
But let him say so then, and let him go;
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
But let my trial be mine own confession:
But let them measure us by what they will;
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
But little thinks we shall be of her council:
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
But makes one pardon strong.
But mantled in your own.
But march to London with our soldiers?
But meditating with two deep divines;
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
But milk my ewes and weep.
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
But my arrival and my wife's in safety
But my entreaty too.
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
But my true love is grown to such excess
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
But neither my good word nor princely favour:
But never once again turn back and fly.
But new struck nine.
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
But none returns. For us to levy power
But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
But not take in the mind.
But not, as I am, royal.
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
But now I see our lances are but straws,
But now I see this one is one too much,
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
But now mischance hath trod my title down,
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
But now you partly may perceive my mind.
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
But of all, the burst
But of the finer natures? by some severals
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
But on his knees at meditation;
But on thy side I may not be too forward
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
But only hope:
But only seeing, all other circumstances
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
But only they have privilege to live.
But owe thy pride thyself.
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
But presently prevent the ways to wail.
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
But rather lose her to an African;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
But sadly tell me who.
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
But say, what to thine old news?
But saying o'er what I have said before:
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
But send him back.
But send me Flavius first.
But set his murdering knife unto the root
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
But shall I live in hope?
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
But shall we wear these honours for a day?
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
But she'll not stumble.
But she's best married that dies married young.
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
But since I cannot, be it known to you
But since correction lieth in those hands
But since he hath
But since it would not, he had none of me.
But since you come too late of our intents,
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
But smacks of something greater than herself,
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
But so is not she.
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
But sound the trumpets, and about our task.
But speedily.
But stay a while: what company is this?
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
But stay, here come the gardeners:
But stir not you till you have well determined
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
But such as I, without your special pardon,
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
But sup them well and look unto them all:
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
But that I do not.
But that I seek occasion how to rise,
But that I was a journeyman to grief?
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
But that he speaks.
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?
But that you have your father's bosom there
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
But then Aufidius was within my view,
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
But there's no remedy.
But they can see a sort of traitors here.
But thine doth fry.
But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?
But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
But this being so, he's just.
But this is something odd.
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
But thou didst kill my children.
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
But thus his simple truth must be abused
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
But till 'twere known!
But time will not permit: all is uneven,
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
But to be rough, unswayable and free.
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
But to defend his person from night-foes?
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
But to her love concerneth us to add
But to himself so secret and so close,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
But to the earth some special good doth give,
But to the next highway, and there I left him.
But to your protestation; let me hear
But toiling desperately to find it out,--
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
But twenty times so much upon my wife.
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
But was a petty servant to the state,
But was not this nigh shore?
But we must win your grace to go with us
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
But we will plant some other in the throne,
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
But what he did being childish?
But what is like me formerly.
But what it is, that is not yet known; what
But what likelihood is in that?
But what my power might else exact, like one
But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
But what said Warwick to these injuries?
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
But what's his offence?
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
But what, is Catesby gone?
But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?
But when I came, some minute ere the time
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
But when from under this terrestrial ball
But when goes this forward?
But when he frown'd, it was against the French
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
But whither shall we then?
But who comes here?
But who comes here?
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
But will you woo this wild-cat?
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
But with a lingering dram that should not work
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
But with her most vile principal, that she's
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
But with such words that are but rooted in
But with that surname; a good memory,
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
But yet I run before my horse to market:
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
But yet my caution was more pertinent
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
But you will take exceptions to my boon.
But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
But your petition
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
But, O, it presses to my memory,
But, Warwick,
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
But, as 'tis,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
But, ere they live, to end.
But, for his purpose in the coronation.
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
But, hark, what noise?
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
But, more of thy news?
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
But, my daughter,
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
But, sir, here comes your boy;
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
But, soft! company is coming here.
But, soft! here come my executioners.
But, soft! what day is this?
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
But, wrangling pedant, this is
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
By Him that raised me to this careful height
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
By Jupiter! forgot.
By Providence divine.
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
By a name
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
By all external warrants, show it now,
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By all their influences, you may as well
By and by, I come:--
By and by.
By any in this presence, I desire
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
By any other name would smell as sweet;
By any understanding pate but thine?
By bare imagination of a feast?
By bud of nobler race: this is an art
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
By course of justice!
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
By each particular star in heaven and
By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
By every syllable a faithful verity:
By fair or foul means we must enter in,
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
By flatterers; and what they will inform,
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
By having him, making yourself no less.
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
By help of her more potent ministers
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
By him that made us all, I am resolved
By his attorneys-general to sue
By his command
By his great authority;
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
By holy marriage: when and where and how
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
By lack of stooping,--
By law and process of great nature thence
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
By many hands your father was subdued;
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
By mine honesty,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
By my head, here come the Capulets.
By my heel, I care not.
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
By my white beard,
By need and accident. What train?
By nothing; for this is no oath:
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
By putting on the destined livery.
By sight of what I have, your noble company.
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
By so much is the wonder in extremes.
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
By such despair, I should accuse myself.
By such invention as I can devise?
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
By that false woman, as this king by thee.
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
By the consent of all, we were establish'd
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
By the king.
By the northern blasts twice o'er.
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
By the woman's means?
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
By this I challenge him to single fight.
By this account then Margaret may win him;
By this alliance to make void my suit:
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
By this time, had the king permitted us,
By this we gather
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
By those that know the very nerves of state,
By throwing it on any other object
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
By vain though apt affection.
By virtue specially to be achieved.
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
By what? by any other house or person?
By which he should revive: and even so
By whom, Camillo?
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
By wicked powers.
By words or blows here let us win our right.
By yielding up thy body to my will;
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
By'r lady, thirty years.

Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
Caius Marcius was
Caius Marcius.
Call Coriolanus.
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
Call for some men of sound direction
Call forth Bagot.
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Call forth an officer.
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
Call in the letters patent that he hath
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
Call it so.
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
Call them forth.
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Call thither all the officers o' the town,
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
Call't not a plot:
Call, good Mercutio.
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Calmly, I do beseech you.
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
Cambio!
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Came he not home to-night?
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
Came short of composition, but in chief
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.
Camillo for the minister to poison
Camillo has betray'd me;
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
Can I demand.
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
Can change their moons and bring their times about
Can clear me in't.
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Can do no more.
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
Can heaven be so envious?
Can lay on nature is a paradise
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
Can set the duke up in despite of me.
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Can thereto frame his spirit.
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
Cannot be!
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Captain:
Captain:
Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
Care not for issue;
Carlisle, this is your doom:
Carnally, she says.
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
Carry me to the gaol!
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
Carthage?
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
Cast your election on him.
Casting their savageness aside have done
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
Catesby!
Catesby!
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
Cease; no more.
Certainly
Certainly, sir, I can.
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
Charges she more than me?
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Children:
Children:
Children:
Choler!
Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:

Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,

Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;

Clarence comes.
Clarence hath not another day to live:
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
Claudio die to-morrow or no?
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
Cleave in the midst, and perish.
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
Close by, my master.

Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
Come I appellant to this princely presence.
Come I too late?
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Come hither, England's hope.
Come hither, Isabel.
Come hither, Mariana.
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?

Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe

Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best

Come on, then,

Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Come to the pedlar;
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
Come unto these yellow sands,
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your

Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.
Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast

Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,

Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,

Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
Come, strike up!
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.
Come, thou tortoise! when?
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
Come, vial.
Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Come, we'll inform them
Come, what talk you
Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
Come, your hand;
Come:
Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
Comes it not something near?
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
Comes to the entertainer--
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.
Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
Cominius, no.
Command an argosy to stem the waves.
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
Commanded always by the greater gust;
Commands me name myself.
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
Commend me to thy lady.
Commend my best obedience to the queen:
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
Commit the war of white and damask in
Commit them to the fire!
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
Committed by your person and your followers
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
Complotted and contrived in this land
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
Concern me the reporting.
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
Condition!
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
Conduct me to the queen.
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
Conformable as other household Kates.
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
Consider further,
Consider of it.'
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Consisting equally of horse and foot;
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
Construe them.
Consul! what consul?
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
Containing the deposing of a king
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
Content, content.
Content.
Content. What is the wager?
Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
Coriolanus banished!
Coriolanus in Corioli?
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
Coriolanus will carry it.
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
Correction and instruction must both work
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Could great men thunder
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
Could he not speak 'em fair?
Could he say less?
Could man so blench?
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Could not have made this peace.
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
Could you not have told him
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
Counting myself but bad till I be best.
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
Courageously and with a free desire
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
Craft against vice I must apply:
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Cry fie upon my grave!
Cry lost, and so good night!
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
Crying confusion.
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Culling the principal of all the deer.
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Cut off by course of justice,--
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;

DUKE:
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare not relate.
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Daring an opposite to every danger:
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
Daughter, well met.
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
Dear for her reputation through the world,
Dear gentlewoman,
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
Dear my brother,
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
Dear, look up:
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
Death is a fearful thing.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
Deep malice makes too deep incision;
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Defiance to the traitor, and so die?
Definitively thus I answer you.
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
Depart again: here, here will I remain
Depose him in the justice of his cause.
Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,
Depress'd he is already, and deposed
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
Deservedly confined into this rock,
Deserves the extremest death.
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Desires access to you.
Desires you to attach his son, who has--
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
Despair not, madam.
Despised substance of divinest show!
Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
Destroy what lies before 'em.
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
Devised impeachments to imprison him :
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
Did I forget that by the house of York
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
Did I put Henry from his native right?
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
Did ever Dian so become a grove
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
Did follow to his urn.
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
Did it to help thee to a better husband.
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
Did shake down mellow fruit.
Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
Did us but loving wrong.
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Did verily bear blood?
Did will what he did spend and spent not that
Did you perceive
Did you such a thing?
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Didst note it?
Didst perceive it?
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
Didst thou not kill this king?
Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
Didst thou not say he comes?
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
Direct me, if it be your will,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
Directitude! what's that?
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
Dishonourable boy!
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
Dismiss them home.
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Dispatch, I prithee.
Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
Dispose of her
Dispose of you.
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
Divide in all with us.
Divided in their dire division,
Divides one thing entire to many objects;
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
Divinely bent to meditation;
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
Do bid it welcome.
Do but mistake.
Do climate here! You have a holy father,
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Do me but right, and you must all confess
Do me this right; hear me with patience.
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
Do not deny to him that you love me.
Do not draw the curtain.
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Do not stand upon't.
Do not swear at all;
Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Do seem to be of ours?
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Do so, and after two days
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
Do strike at my injustice.
Do their best office, if they can but stay you
Do then: but I'll not hear.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you call, sir?
Do you hear how he misplaces?
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
Do you hear?
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
Do you neglect them?
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
Do you not hear me speak?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
Do you quarrel, sir?
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Do you your office, or give up your place,
Do your will.
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.
Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
Do, Paulina;
Do, and be witness to 't.
Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
Does change my disposition.
Does my deeds make the blacker!
Does not approve me further, who was wont
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Does reason our petition with more strength
Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
Done. The wager?
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
Dost thou attend me?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
Dost thou detest her therefore?
Dost thou forget
Dost thou hear?
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
Dost thou not laugh?
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
Doth he so seek his life?
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
Doting like me and like me banished,
Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
Doubt not
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Down with him! down with him!
Down with him, down with him!
Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
Draw near,
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
Draw near, ye people.
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
Drest in a little brief authority,
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
Dropping upon thy head.
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Dull, unmindful villain,
During his power, go sleep.
During the wars of York and Lancaster
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be

Each day still better other's happiness;
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Each one already blazing by our meeds,
Each one demand an answer to his part
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
Each way, to better yours.
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
Edward will always bear himself as king:
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Edward, kneel down.
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Either forbear,
Either heaven with lightning strike the
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
Either of condemnation or approof;
Either of you to be the other's end.
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
Either withdraw unto some private place,
Either you must
Elected him our absence to supply,
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
Eleven, sir.
Else let my brother die,
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Embrace each other's love in banishment;
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
Endured all weathers.
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
Enforce the present execution
Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
Enforced us to this execution?
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
England is safe, if true within itself?
England, bound in with the triumphant sea
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
Enough, my lord.
Enough, with over-measure.
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?
Envied against the people, seeking means
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Environed he was with many foes,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
Ere a fortnight make me elder,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Ere further leisure yield them further means
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Ere he express himself, or move the people
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
Ere stay behind this business.
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
Ere this rude beast will profit.
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
Escalus.
Especially in pride.
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
Even by your own.
Even for revenge mock my destruction!
Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
Even from this instant, banish him our city,
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
Even he, Biondello.
Even he, my lord.
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Even here undone!
Even in condition of the worst degree,
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
Even in the lusty havior of his son.
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Even in these honest mean habiliments:
Even in these looks I made.
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
Even so
Even so as I mine own course have set down:
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Even to my person, than I thought he would
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
Even to the general all-ending day.
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
Even to their ships.
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
Even when you please, since you will have it so.
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
Even with the same austerity and garb
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
Ever right.
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
Evermore showering? In one little body
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
Examine every married lineament,
Examine other beauties.
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
Except the marshal and such officers
Excepting one, I would he were the best
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
Exeter, so will I.
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought

Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Fairly offer'd.
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
Faith, I know not what to say.
Faith, as cold as can be.
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
Faith, here it is.
Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
Faith, there had been many great men that have
Faith, we hear fearful news.
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
False accusation blush and tyranny
False to his children or his wife's allies
False to my nature? Rather say I play
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
Falsely to take away a life true made
Fame, at the which he aims,
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Fan you into despair! Have the power still
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
Fare ye well:
Fare you well.
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.
Farewell till soon.
Farewell!
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Farewell, dear father!
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
Farewell, farewell.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
Farewell, my coz.
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Farewell, my lord: securely I espy
Farewell, my sovereign.
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
Farewell, our brother.
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.
Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
Farewell.
Farewell.
Farewell.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
Faster than thought or time.
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
Father, you cannot disinherit me:
Father:

Father:
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
Fear me not.
Fear me not.
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
Fear not our care, sir.
Fear not that, my lord.
Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.
Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
Feeling so the loss,
Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
Fellow Grumio!
Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
Fie, fie! no thought of him:
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
Fie, fie, fie!
Fie, fie, fie!
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!
Fifth Citizen:
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
Find them out whose names are written here! It is
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,

First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
First if all obstacles were cut away,
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
First will I see the coronation;
First, an it like you, the house is a respected
First, as you know, my house within the city
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
First, hear me speak.
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
First, let her show her face, and after speak.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
Flattering me with impossibilities.
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Flower of warriors,
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Fly to the duke:
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Follow me.
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
Following the fliers at the very heels,
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
Fool-hardiness; not I.
Foot it featly here and there;
For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
For 'tis a sore upon us,
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
For 'tis most dangerous.
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
For Angelo,
For Christian service and true chivalry,
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
For Edward will defend the town and thee,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
For I am all the subjects that you have,
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
For I am loath to break our country's laws.
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
For I have bills for money by exchange
For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
For I have ever verified my friends,
For I have given here my soul's consent
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
For I have heard it said
For I have heard that she was there in place.
For I have more to commune with Bianca.
For I have murdered where I should not kill.
For I have need of many orisons
For I have none: let no man speak again
For I have often heard my mother say
For I intend but only to surprise him.
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
For I myself am not so well provided
For I myself have many tears to wash
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
For I repent me that the duke is slain.
For I shall never speak to thee again.
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
For I will kiss her.
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
For I would commune with you of such things
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
For Mowbray and myself are like two men
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
For Rome, towards Marcius.
For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
For Warwick is a subtle orator,
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
For York in justice puts his armour on.
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
For a reply, at least if you make a care
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
For a worthy lady
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
For all the rest is held at such a rate
For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
For aught I know, my lord, they do.
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
For beauty starved with her severity
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
For both hast thou, and both become the grave.
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
For by my scouts I was advertised
For by that loss I will not purchase them.
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
For certain words he spake against your grace
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
For curious I cannot be with you,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
For did I but suspect a fearful man
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
For do we must what force will have us do.
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
For ever
For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
For ever will I walk upon my knees,
For every cloud engenders not a storm.
For every inch of woman in the world,
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
For every pelting, petty officer
For exile hath more terror in his look,
For fair without the fair within to hide:
For false forswearing and for murder too:
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
For few men rightly temper with the stars:
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For hardy and undoubted champions;
For has not the divine Apollo said,
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
For he fears none.
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
For he is just and always loved us well.
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
For he that interrupts him shall not live.
For he was fitter for that place than earth.
For her poor brother's pardon.
For her, my lord,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
For here we need it not.
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
For his advantage that I dearly love.
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
For hither we have broken in by force.
For hither will our friends repair to us.
For how I firmly am resolved you know;
For how can I help them, and not myself?
For how can tyrants safely govern home,
For hunting was his daily exercise.
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
For in a minute there are many days:
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
For in an act of this importance 'twere
For in the marches here we heard you were,
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
For inequality; but let your reason serve
For insurrection's arguing.
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
For it is done, my lord.
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
For it was bad enough before their spite.
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
For learning me your language!
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
For making me, so young, so old a widow!
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
For man or master; then it follows thus;
For many lives stand between me and home:
For many men that stumble at the threshold
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
For me as for you?
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
For me to try how: all I know of it
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
For mine own part,
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
For my lads to give their dears:
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
For my poor brother's head.
For my prosperity!
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
For never henceforth shall I joy again,
For never was a story of more woe
For never yet one hour in his bed
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
For no less spoil than glory,--
For no thought is contented. The better sort,
For nothing but his majesty's approach.
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
For nothing had begot my something grief;
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
For now the devil, that told me I did well,
For now they kill me with a living death.
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
For of joy, being altogether wanting,
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
For on thy fortune I repose myself.
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
For one poor grain or two!
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
For our case is as theirs.
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
For present comfort and for future good,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
For raising this sea-storm?
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
For she did print your royal father off,
For she is changed, as she had never been.
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
For she's a woman to be pitied much:
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
For sinking under them.
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
For so your father charged me at our parting,
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
For such a warped slip of wilderness
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
For such an injury would vex a very saint,
For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
For tender princes, use my babies well!
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
For that I was his father Edward's son;
For that he has,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
For that her reputation was disvalued
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
For that which, if myself might be his judge,
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
For the deposing of a rightful king.
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
For the in which doth control't.
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
For the instalment of this noble duke
For the most gentle Claudio.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
For their advantage and your highness' loss.
For their own good and ours.
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
For then I pity those I do not know,
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
For then this land was famously enrich'd
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
For these known evils, but to give me leave,
For they account his head upon the bridge.
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
For they do prank them in authority,
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
For they that were your enemies are his,
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
For this alliance may so happy prove,
For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.
For this design. What course I mean to hold
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
For this new-married man approaching here,
For this night's watching.
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
For this poor furniture and mean array.
For this reason, if you'll know,
For this time, all the rest depart away:
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
For this will out, and here I must not stay.
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
For this, consorted with the citizens,
For those defects I have before rehearsed,
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
For thou must now know farther.
For thou set'st on thy wife.
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
For through this laund anon the deer will come;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
For thy great bounty, that not only givest
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
For to a vision so apparent rumour
For to supply the places at the table,
For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
For visiting your highness: my best train
For we are peremptory to dispatch
For we are soft as our complexions are,
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
For we were subjects but while you were king.
For we will make for Ireland presently.
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
For what I have I need not to repeat;
For what before it was.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
For what he did before Corioli, call him,
For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
For what is in this world but grief and woe?
For what offence?
For what reason, I beseech you?
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
For what, I pray thee?
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
For what?
For when I was a king, my flatterers
For which I do discharge you of your office:
For which I must not plead, but that I am
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
For which the heavens, taking angry note,
For which the people stir: if you will pass
For which you are a traitor to the people.
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
For who is living, if those two are gone?
For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
For wise men say it is the wisest course.
For with a band of thirty thousand men
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
For yet his honour never heard a play--
For yet is hope of life and victory.
For you and I are past our dancing days:
For you have but mistook me all this while:
For you must know, we have with special soul
For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.
For your best health and recreation.
For your broken shin.
For your physicians have expressly charged,
For's private friends: his answer to me was,
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
For, being transported by my jealousies
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
For, by the honour of my parents, I
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
For, look you, I may make the belly smile
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
For, though before his face I speak the words
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Forbiddenly.
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
Force her hence.
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
Forerunning more requital.
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.
Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
Forgetting any other home but this.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
Fortune speed us!
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
Foul weather?
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
Found that the issue was not his begot;
Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
Four or five women once that tended me?
Fourth Citizen:
Fourth Citizen:
Fourth Citizen:
Fourth Messenger:
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
Frenchwoman.
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
Friend,
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
From Florence and must here deliver them.
From France?
From London by the king was I press'd forth;
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
From Rome.
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
From all dishonesty he can: in this,
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
From course required; or else thou must be counted
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
From every meaner man.
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
From giving aid which late I promised.
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
From me do back receive the flour of all,
From me receive that natural competency
From me, the lord on't.
From mine own library with volumes that
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
From my own windows torn my household coat,
From my succession wipe me, father; I
From off my hands, here in the view of men
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
From our free person she should be confined,
From out the fiery portal of the east,
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
From rascals worse than they.
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
From the corruption of abusing times,
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
From the most gracious regent of this land,
From the noise of our own drums.'
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
From thee, even from thy virtue!
From their abominable and beastly touches
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
From these our Henry lineally descends.
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
From those that wish the downfall of our house!
From those you sent to the oracle are come
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
From what a torment I did free thee?
From when this stream through muddy passages
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
From whence?
From where he should begin and end, but will
From where you do remain let paper show.
From which awaked, the truth of what we are
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
From your good queen.
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Full half an hour.
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Further I say and further will maintain
Further than seen and one infect another

Gloucester and Buckingham.
Gloucester,
Gloucester;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.
Go about it.
Go ask his name: if he be married.
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
Go do it instantly.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
Go in to him, and fetch him out.
Go in, Bianca:
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Go levy men, and make prepare for war;
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
Go not home.

Go on, and fetch our horses back again.

Go thou away:
Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both

Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
Go thou, and like an executioner,
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
Go to, go to!
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
Go to, go to;
Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
Go to, then.
Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
Go to; I say you shall.
Go to; let that be mine:
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;

Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go

Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
Go; away with her to prison!

God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
God bless your grace with health and happy days!
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
God for his mercy, what treachery is here!
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
God give him joy!
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
God give your graces both

God will revenge it; whom I will importune
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
Good even, good father.
Good even. Friar, where's the provost?
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
Good faith, I'll prove him,
Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
Good friar, let's hear it.

Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
Good heart, at what?
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,

Good morrow, Richmond!
Good morrow, father.
Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
Good mother, be content; it is no more
Good my friends,
Good my liege, I come;
Good my lord,
Good my lord, be cured
Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
Good my lord, forbear:
Good my lord,--
Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Good night, good night! parting is such
Good night.
Good night.
Good night:
Good or bad?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
Good queen!
Good queen, my lord,
Good queen; I say good queen;
Good sir, adieu.
Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
Good things will strive to dwell with't.
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
Good time of day unto your royal grace!
Good uncle, help to order several powers
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Grace go with you, Benedicite!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
Grace to boot!
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
Gracious my lord,
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
Grandam, his nurse.
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Grant me this boon.
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
Great Apollo
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
Great cause to give great thanks.
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
Great king, within this coffin I present
Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
Groan! why, no.
Groom:
Groom:
Groom:
Groom:
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
Grumio gave order how it should be done.
Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.
Grumio, my horse.
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,

Had I been there, which am a silly woman,

Had I more name for badness.
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.

Had he none else to make a stale but me?
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
Had loved you as we did.
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
Had our prince,
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
Had she such power,
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Had you a special warrant for the deed?
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
Had you such leisure in the time of death
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
Hadst thou beheld--
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Hadst thou groan'd for him
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
Hag-seed, hence!
Hail sir!
Hail to you both!
Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
Hail, most royal sir!
Hail, noble Marcius!
Hail, royal prince!
Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Haled out to murder: myself on every post
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Half an hour since brought my report.
Hang 'em! They say!
Hang all the husbands
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Happier the man, whom favourable stars
Happily
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
Happy be you!
Happy return be to your royal grace!
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happy were England, would this gracious prince
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:
Hardly one subject.
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
Hark in thine ear.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
Hark ye;
Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--
Hark you. far off!
Hark! a drum.
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.
Hark! our drums
Hark! the trumpets.
Hark, Perdita
Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
Hark, hark!
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?
Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
Harry, how fares your uncle?
Has censured him
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Has made thee swell thus.
Has said enough.
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
Hast thou read truth?
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
Hast thou, spirit,
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
Hasting to the court.
Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
Hath been beyond account.
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
Hath from the number of his banish'd years
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Hath he a sister?
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
Hath he so long held out with me untired,
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Hath made his meal on thee?
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
Hath overta'en mine act.
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
Hath promised me to help me to another,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Hath she had any more than one husband?
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
Have I had children's voices?
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Have I in such a prison.
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
Have any resting for her true king's queen.
Have at thee, coward!
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
Have done the time more benefit and graced
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
Have done, have done.
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
Have holp to make this rescue?
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
Have moved his highness to commit me now.
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Have now the fatal object in my eye
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
Have said and writ so, but your writing now
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
Have taken treasure from her lips--
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
Have thy desire.
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
Have too much blood in him.
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
Have we march'd on without impediment;
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
Have we no wine here?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Have we pass'd through, not without much content
Have with you.
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
Have you
Have you a catalogue
Have you a father?
Have you collected them by tribes?
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
Have you deserved: it is my father's music
Have you done there?
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
Have you importuned him by any means?
Have you inform'd them sithence?
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
Have you not set them on?
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Have you thought on
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Having determined of the Volsces and
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
Having fully dined before.
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
Having no other reason
Having no warrant.
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
He and Aufidius can no more atone
He approaches: you shall hear him.
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
He be as miserably slain as I.
He bear himself with honourable action,
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
He bow'd his nature, never known before
He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He came alive to land.
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
He cannot temperately transport his honours
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
He consul!
He could have temporized.
He could never come better; he shall come in. I
He could not miss't.
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
He cried upon it at the merest loss
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
He did solicit you in free contempt
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
He did, my lord.
He did.
He dies for Claudio's death.
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
He dies to-night.
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
He does it under name of perfect love;
He does me double wrong
He does well in 't.
He doth appear.
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
He dreads his wife.
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
He flouted us downright.
He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
He has betray'd your business, and given up,
He has discover'd my design, and I
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
He has it now, and by his looks methink
He has no equal.
He has our voices, sir.
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
He hath a garden circummured with brick,
He hath abused your powers.
He hath but as offended in a dream!
He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
He hath good usage and great liberty,
He hath got his friend with child.
He hath hereto prized them at.
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
He hath not money for these Irish wars,
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
He hath, my lord.
He heard the name of death.
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
He is as like thee as a man may be,
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
He is coming.
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
He is no less than what we say he is.
He is not guilty of her coming hither.
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
He is wise;
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
He is.
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
He kills her in her own humour.
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
He little thought of this divided friendship:
He lived from all attainder of suspect.
He lives that loves thee better than he could.
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
He loved his mother dearly.
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
He loves your people
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
He made you for a highway to my bed;
He makes a July's day short as December,
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
He may command me as my sovereign;
He may surrender; so we shall proceed
He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
He might have kept that glory to this day;
He misses not much.
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
He must, and will
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
He neither does nor shall.
He prays but faintly and would be denied;
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
He professes to have received no sinister measure
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
He rose against him, being his sovereign,
He said he had wounds, which he could show
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
He says so, Tranio.
He says, to veil full purpose.
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
He sends ye not to murder me for this
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
He shall be endured:
He shall be none;
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
He shall here find his friends with horse and men
He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
He shall not rule me.
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
He shall not.
He shall well know
He shall, sure on't.
He shortens four years of my son's exile:
He should have braved the east an hour ago
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
He should have had a volume of farewells;
He should have leave to go away betimes,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
He slily stole away and left his men:
He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
He something seems unsettled.
He speak against me on the adverse side,
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
He swore consent to your succession,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
He tells her something
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
He that has but effected his good will
He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
He that no more must say is listen'd more
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
He thus should steal upon us.
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
He took good rest to-night;
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
He waged me with his countenance, as if
He wants advice.
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
He was a man; this, in respect, a child:
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
He was not taken well; he had not dined:
He was the author, thou the instrument.
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
He was your enemy, ever spake against
He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
He who the sword of heaven will bear
He will allow no speech, which I do guess
He will be talking.
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
He will not wake.
He will shake
He wishes earnestly you never may.
He wonders to what end you have assembled
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
He would not answer to: forbad all names;
He would not call me son.
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
He would not seem to know me.
He would not stay at your petitions: made
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
He'll be hang'd yet,
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
He'll never hear him.
He'll stay my lord.
He'll think anon it lives.
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
He's a disease that must be cut away.
He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
He's beat from his best ward.
He's coming.
He's gentle and not fearful.
He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
He's irremoveable,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
He's right noble:
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.
He's sentenced; no more hearing.
He's simple and tells much.
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
He's the devil.
He's very likely now to fall from him,
He's with the king your father.
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
He, more incensed against your majesty
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Hear a little further
Hear from me still, and never of me aught
Hear me a word;
Hear me one word;
Hear me speak:
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
Hear me, people; peace!
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
Hear nothing from him.
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
Hear you the news abroad?
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Hearest thou, Biondello?
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Heaven give your spirits comfort!
Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
Heaven keep your honour safe!
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
Heaviness in me.
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
Help Marcius, help,
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
Help, help! Call help.
Help, help, help!
Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Help, ye citizens!
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.
Hence with it, and together with the dam
Hence! hang not on my garments.
Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Hence, old goat!
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Henry Bolingbroke
Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
Her brother, having both their country quitted
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Her children not her husband's!
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
Her father is Baptista Minola,
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
Her life is only safest in her birth.
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Her natural posture!
Her new-built virtue and obedience.
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.
Her portion equal his.
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
Herald:
Herald:
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
Here am I left to underprop his land,
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Here come more voices.
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
Here come the clusters.
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
Here come the lords.
Here come those I have done good to against my will,
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
Here comes Bohemia.
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
Here comes a messenger. What news?
Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!
Here comes his mother.
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
Here comes my son Aumerle.
Here comes the Duke of York.
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
Here comes the rogue.
Here comes your father: never make denial;
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
Here cousin:
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Here in Vienna, sir.
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Here in the prison, father,
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
Here in this country, where we now remain.
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Here in your city; I now came from him:
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
Here is everything advantageous to life.
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
Here is the steed, we the caparison:
Here let us breathe and haply institute
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:
Here sits a king more woful than you are.
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
Here were the servants of your adversary,
Here where we are.
Here's Lucentio,
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
Here's a strange alteration!
Here's ado,
Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
Here's goodly gear!
Here's goodly work!
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
Here's to my love!
Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
Here, here, sir; here, sir.
Here, if it like your honour.
Here, madam:
Here, master: what cheer?
Here, most gracious liege.
Here, my lord.
Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?
Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.
Here, take away this dish.
Here.
Here.
Here: what's the matter?
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
Hereditary ours.
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
Hie you to church; I must another way,
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
Hilloa, loa!
Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
His absolute 'shall'?
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
His answer was, he would unto the stews,
His answer was, the people were not wont
His arms in this sad knot.
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
His body couched in a curious bed,
His body to that pleasant country's earth,
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,
His business more material.
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
His charters and his customary rights;
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
His coming hither hath no further scope
His country's bowels out. And to poor we
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
His currish riddles sort not with this place.
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
His deeds with doing them, and is content
His deputy anointed in His sight,
His dignity and duty both cast off--
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
His execution sworn.
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
His face still combating with tears and smiles,
His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
His filth within being cast, he would appear
His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
His garments are rich, but he wears
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,
His good sword in his hand.
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
His head is off and sent to Angelo.
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
His honour and myself are at the one,
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
His insolence can brook to be commanded
His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
His issue disinherited should be;
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
His majesty
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
His name and credit shall you undertake,
His name is Barnardine.
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
His nature is too noble for the world:
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.
His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
His oath enrolled in the parliament;
His old betrothed but despised;
His own impatience
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
His princess, say you, with him?
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
His reasons with his body.
His regiment lies half a mile at least
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
His resemblance, being not like the duke;
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
His smiles,
His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
His son is thirty.
His son was but a ward two years ago.
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
His very air, that I should call you brother,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
His wife is in Corioli and his child
His wish'd ability, he had himself
His wit set down to make his valour live
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
Ho! who is within there?
Ho! who's here?
Ho, by your leave!
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
Hold me a foe;
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
Hold thy desperate hand:
Hold thy peace:
Hold up before him?
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
Hold you there: farewell.
Hold your peaces.
Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Hold, hold, hold, hold!
Hold, take my ring.
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
Holla, within!
Holloa me like a hare.
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
Hope I may choose, sir.
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
Hortensio, hark:
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
Hostess:
Hostess:
Hostess:
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Hover about her; say, that right for right
Hover about me with your airy wings
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
How I have ever loved the life removed
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
How I may formally in person bear me
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How accompanied?
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
How blest am I
How but well, sir? how but well?
How came it that the absent duke had not either
How came we ashore?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
How can you say to me, I am a king?
How canst thou try them so?
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
How canst thou woo her?
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
How chance the prophet could not at that time
How could he stay till Warwick made return?
How could that be?
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
How do you now?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
How does the boy?
How dost thou feel thyself now?
How dost thou know that, constable?
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
How far I am from the desire thereof.
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?
How far into the morning is it, lords?
How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
How far off is our brother Montague?
How far off lie these armies?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
How fares my noble lord?
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
How fares our gracious lady?
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?
How fares the prince?
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
How happy then were my ensuing death!
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
How hast thou offended?
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
How have you slept, my lord?
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
How if it be false, son?
How if it come to thee again?
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
How is it with Titus Lartius?
How is it with our general?
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
How it goes with us, and do look to know
How know you that?
How lies their battle? know you on which side
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
How long a time lies in one little word!
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
How long hath he been there?
How long is't now since last yourself and I
How long is't since?
How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
How many days will finish up the year;
How many hours bring about the day;
How many make the hour full complete;
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
How many years a mortal man may live.
How may likeness made in crimes,
How merited to be so; since he came,
How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
How more unfortunate than all living women
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
How near the tidings of our comfort is.
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
How not your own desire?
How now there!
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
How now! canst stand?
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
How now! what means death in this rude assault?
How now! what news with you?
How now! what news?
How now! what news?
How now! what news?
How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
How now! what's the matter?
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
How now! what's the news with you?
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
How now! who calls?
How now! who is it?
How now! who's there?
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
How now, Grumio!
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
How now, fair maid?
How now, fair shepherd!
How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?
How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
How now, old lad?
How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
How now, what news with you?
How now? moody?
How oft when men are at the point of death
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
How often said, my dignity would last
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
How say you, Signior Gremio?
How say you?
How shall that faith return again to earth,
How shall this bisson multitude digest
How shall we do for money for these wars?
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
How should he be made, then?
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
How should this grow?
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.
How stands your disposition to be married?
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
How tame, when men and women are alone,
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
How thou camest here thou mayst.
How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
How to deny them, who to advance and who
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
How well my comfort is revived by this!
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
How went he under him?
How will my mother for a father's death
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
How will the country for these woful chances
How would he look, to see his work so noble
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How!
How! I inform them!
How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
How! away!
How! bribe me?
How! caught of me!
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
How! gone!
How! know you where you are?
How! no more!
How! not women?
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
How! traitor!
How! turn thy back and run?
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
How, Camillo,
How, my lord!
How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
How?
How?
How? the best?
How? thy wife?
How? what?
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
However God or fortune cast my lot,
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Humbling their deities to love, have taken
Humbly complaining to her deity
Hungary's!
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
Huntsman:
Huntsman:
Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
I am a Roman; and my services are,
I am a feather for each wind that blows:
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
I am a king, and privileged to speak.
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I am a poor fellow, sir.
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
I am about, let them depart.
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
I am afraid, sir,
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
I am always bound to you.
I am an officer of state, and come
I am angling now,
I am appointed him to murder you.
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
I am as ignorant in that as you
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
I am ashamed that women are so simple
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
I am bound to you:
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
I am combined by a sacred vow
I am come to know your pleasure.
I am content to be Lucentio,
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
I am content to look on: what to speak,
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
I am content, in a good father's care,
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I am content.
I am content.
I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
I am denied to sue my livery here,
I am determined to prove a villain
I am directed by you.
I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
I am for thee straight: take thou the
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
I am for you.
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
I am glad at heart
I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
I am glad to see your ladyship.
I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
I am gone for ever.
I am his brother, and I love him well.
I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
I am hurt.
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
I am in all affected as yourself;
I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
I am in parliament pledge for his truth
I am in your debt for your last exercise;
I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
I am innocent as you.'
I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
I am like you, they say.
I am my father's heir and only son:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
I am none, by this good light.
I am not I, if there be such an I;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
I am not in the giving vein to-day.
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
I am not yet instructed.
I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
I am so fraught with curious business that
I am so sorry for my trespass made
I am sorry for't:
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
I am that Isabella and his sister.
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
I am the greatest, able to do least,
I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?
I am the sister of one Claudio,
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
I am thine.
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
I am thy sovereign.
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
I am too childish-foolish for this world.
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
I am unfit for state and majesty;
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
I am your better, traitors as ye are:
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
I am your free dependant.
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
I am your wife in all obedience.
I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
I am, as thy general is.
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
I assure you, Carthage.
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
I beseech you, peace:
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
I beseech your honour, ask me.
I bid them that did love their country's good
I blame not her, she could say little less;
I bless the time
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
I call thee not.
I call them forth to credit her.
I call upon thee.
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I came from Edward as ambassador,
I came into the world with my legs forward:
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
I can add colours to the chameleon,
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
I can no longer hold me patient.
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
I cannot help it now,
I cannot joy, until I be resolved
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
I cannot make you what amends I would,
I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
I cannot say 'tis pity
I cannot speak
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
I cannot speak, nor think
I cannot stay to hear these articles.
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
I care not.
I care not:
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
I charged thee that she should not come about me:
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
I come about my brother.
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
I come to know your pleasure.
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
I confess the cape.
I confess two sleeves.
I conjure only but to raise up him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
I could afflict you farther.
I could beat forty of them.
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
I could myself
I could not send it,--here it is again,--
I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
I count myself in nothing else so happy
I crave no other, nor no better man.
I crave their pardons:
I crave your blessing.
I crave your honour's pardon.
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
I cry thee mercy:
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
I dare be sworn
I dare be sworn you were:
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
I dare no longer stay.
I dare not know, my lord.
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
I dare not, sir
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
I departed not and left him there.
I did but smile till now:
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
I did in time collect myself and thought
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
I did not kill your husband.
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
I did not well I meant well. All my services
I did not, sir:
I did, my lord.
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
I do assure thee, father, so it is.
I do believe it.
I do believe thee:
I do beseech thee--
I do beseech you send for some of them.
I do beseech you,
I do beseech you,
I do beseech you, either not believe
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
I do beweep to many simple gulls
I do bite my thumb, sir.
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
I do confess it, and repent it, father.
I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
I do defy him, and I spit at him;
I do defy thy conjurations,
I do demand,
I do desire the like.
I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
I do fear, too dreadful:
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
I do it not in evil disposition,
I do lament the sickness of the king.
I do mistake my person all this while:
I do not know that Englishman alive
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
I do not like the Tower, of any place.
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
I do not like these several councils, I.
I do not like this news.
I do not love to look on.
I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
I do not sue to stand;
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
I do not, sir.
I do owe them still
I do present you with a man of mine,
I do protest, I never injured thee,
I do refer me to the oracle:
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
I do remember an apothecary,--
I do remember well where I should be,
I do repent me, as it is an evil,
I do repent me; read not my name there
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
I do suspect I have done some offence
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
I do well believe your highness; and
I do, my lord.
I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
I do; and surely
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
I dreamt my master and another fought,
I drew to part them: in the instant came
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
I ever saw so noble.
I every day expect an embassage
I fear he will.
I fear it is too choleric a meat.
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
I fear me both are false.
I fear me, never.
I fear no uncles dead.
I fear our happiness is at the highest.
I fear you not.
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
I fear, I fear,--
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
I find my zenith doth depend upon
I find myself a traitor with the rest;
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
I follow you.
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
I found the effect of love in idleness:
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
I give my daughter to him, and will make
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
I give this heavy weight from off my head
I go, my lord.
I go, my lord.
I go.
I go.
I go. Write to me very shortly.
I go: and towards three or four o'clock
I go; and if you plead as well for them
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
I got them in my country's service, when
I grant ye.
I grant; as there may between the lists and the
I guess not.
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
I had been mercenary.
I had been still a happy king of men.
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I had forgot myself; am I not king?
I had rather be a country servant-maid
I had rather be their servant in my way,
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
I had rather give my body than my soul.
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
I have a king here to my flatterer.
I have a motion much imports your good;
I have a servant comes with me along,
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
I have advertised him by secret means
I have already.
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
I have been consul, and can show for Rome
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
I have been studying how I may compare
I have bethought me of another fault.
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
I have borne this business.
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
I have deserved no better entertainment,
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I have done.
I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
I have heard, but not believed,
I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
I have it, Tranio.
I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!
I have known my husband; yet my husband
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
I have lived
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
I have loved thee,--
I have more care to stay than will to go:
I have my wish.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
I have no brother, I am like no brother;
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
I have no more sons of the royal blood
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
I have not been desirous of their wealth,
I have not deserved it.
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
I have not yet made known to Mariana
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
I have provided for you: stay awhile,
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
I have reserved alive.
I have sat here all day.
I have sat too long.
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
I have seen them in the church together: God send
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
I have too few to take my leave of you,
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
I have with such provision in mine art
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
I have, my liege.
I have.
I have.
I have.
I have: but what of him?
I have; 'tis ready.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
I hear that news, my lord.
I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
I heard him swear,
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
I here bestow a simple instrument,
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
I here resign my government to thee,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
I hold you a penny,
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
I hope all's for the best.
I hope better.
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.
I hope so.
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
I hope the king made peace with all of us
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
I humbly thank you.
I humbly thank you.
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
I kneel before thee; and unproperly
I knew she would.
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
I know her answer.
I know her father, though I know not her;
I know him for a man divine and holy;
I know him not, but I have heard of him;
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
I know it is the moon.
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
I know it well. What must I call her?
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
I know it;
I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
I know no further:
I know none. Can you tell me of any?
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
I know not what to do: I would to God,
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
I know not what; but format in apparel,
I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
I know not whether to depart in silence,
I know not, an't like you.
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
I know not, sir.
I know not.
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
I know thee not: thy name?
I know them both.
I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
I know this cannot be.
I know ye well enough.
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
I know you well, sir, and you know
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
I know't too well.
I know, in honour, O, that ever I
I know, they do attend us.
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
I lay me down a little while to breathe;
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?
I leave out ceremony.
I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
I like it better than a dangerous honour.
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.
I like you, lads; about your business straight;
I like your silence, it the more shows off
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
I little like.
I live to look upon their tragedy.
I live with bread like you, feel want,
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.
I love them as they weigh.
I loved him as in honour he required,
I loved the maid I married; never man
I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
I make you both protectors of this land,
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
I may be consul.
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
I may entitle thee my loving father:
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
I may not answer.
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
I may not suffer you to visit them;
I may not, madam:
I may not, verily.
I may spur on my journey.
I may, and will, if she be so contented:
I mean for your particular,--you had not
I mean our preservation, few in millions
I mean our princely father, Duke of York.
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
I mean to take possession of my right.
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
I mean, in bearing weight of government,
I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
I mean, sir, in delay
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
I mean, thy general.
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
I might call him
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.
I moralize two meanings in one word.
I muse my mother
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
I must away to-day, before night come:
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
I must be married to my brother's daughter,
I must be patient till the heavens look
I must be present at your conference.
I must begin with rudiments of art;
I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I must believe you, sir:
I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
I must confess your offer is the best;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
I must eat my dinner.
I must have leave to pass.
I must have patience to endure the load:
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
I must obey: his art is of such power,
I must perforce. Farewell.
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
I ne'er heard yet
I need not add more fuel to your fire,
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
I neither care for the world nor your general: for
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
I never did her any, to my knowledge.
I never did incense his majesty
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
I never heard any soldier dislike it.
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
I never in my life did look on him.
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
I never look'd for better at his hands,
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
I never saw the like.
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
I never thought it possible or likely;
I never was nor never will be false.
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
I never yet beheld that special face
I not purpose it.
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
I now go toward him; therefore follow me
I now name to you; and with speed so pace
I now repent I told the pursuivant
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I offer'd to awaken his regard
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
I pardon him.
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
I play the torturer, by small and small
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
I pray God he be not, I say.
I pray now, call her.
I pray now, keep below.
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
I pray thee, mark me.
I pray thee, moralize them.
I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
I pray you do.
I pray you home to dinner with me.
I pray you stand good father to me now,
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
I pray you, let it stand.
I pray you, sir, is it your will
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I prithee now, my son,
I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
I prithee,
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
I prithee, hear me speak.
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
I prithee, spare.
I prize above my dukedom.
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
I promise you, but for your company,
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
I promised here to meet.
I promised to inquire carefully
I promised we would be contributors
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
I saw him beat the surges under him,
I saw him in the battle range about;
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
I say it is the moon.
I say it shall be so.
I say she shall: and first begin with her.
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
I say, a husband.
I say, bid come before us Angelo.
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
I say, without characters, fame lives long.
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.
I see a woman may be made a fool,
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
I see the play so lies
I see thy glory like a shooting star
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
I see you do not mean to part with her,
I see your brows are full of discontent,
I see, as in a map, the end of all.
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
I shall be reconciled to him again.
I shall be, if I claim by open war.
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
I shall discharge to the life.
I shall do good.
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
I shall inform them.
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
I shall not need transport my words by you;
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
I shall obey him.
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
I shall report,
I shall return before your lordship thence.
I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
I shall, my lord.
I shall, sir.
I shall, sir. Fare you well.
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
I should do so in honour: I am in this,
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
I should knock you here, sir?
I should lament thy miserable state.
I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
I should not for my life but weep with him.
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
I should sin
I should so.
I should to Plashy too;
I show it most of all when I show justice;
I sin in envying his nobility,
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
I smell the trick on't.
I so much thirst to see.
I something do excuse the thing I hate,
I sometime lay here in Corioli
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
I speak no more than every one doth know.
I speak no more than what my soul intends;
I speak no treason.
I speak not this as doubting any here
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
I spy life peering; but I dare not say
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.
I stagger in:--but this new governor
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
I strike quickly, being moved.
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
I swear to do this, though a present death
I swear--
I swear.
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
I take my leave before I have begun,
I take my leave of you.
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
I take thee at thy word:
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
I talk of that, that know it.
I talk of you:
I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
I tell thee, Catesby--
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
I tell thee, fellow,
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
I tell you, friends, most charitable care
I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
I thank my God for my humility.
I thank my liege, that in regard of me
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
I thank thee, master.
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.
I thank you, general;
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
I thank you, good friend Lucio.
I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
I thank you, sir.
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
I thank you. Fare you well.
I thank your grace.
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
I thank your worship for your good counsel:
I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
I the great toe! why the great toe?
I then crave pardon of your majesty.
I then do most go right.
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
I think 'twill serve, if he
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
I think I shall command your welcome here,
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
I think his understanding is bereft.
I think it best you married with the county.
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
I think it well:
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
I think not so.
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
I think so too; for never gazed the moon
I think so. Kill'd!
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
I think there is not in the world either malice or
I think there's never a man in Christendom
I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
I think you are happy in this second match,
I think you have
I think, Camillo?
I think, or in any religion.
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
I thought all for the best.
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
I thought my mother, and my brother York,
I thought no less: it is his policy
I thought of her,
I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
I thought you had been willing to resign.
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
I told her so, my lord,
I told him that your father was at Venice,
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
I told your majesty as much before:
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
I trembling waked, and for a season after
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
I wake before the time that Romeo
I wander from the jewels that I love.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
I warrant him consul.
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
I warrant thee.
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.
I warrant you, my lord.
I warrant you.
I warrant your honour.
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
I was adopted heir by his consent:
I was anointed king at nine months old;
I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
I was moved withal.
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
I was promised them against the feast; but they come
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
I was too hot to do somebody good,
I was too strict to make mine own away;
I was your mother much upon these years
I was, my lord.
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
I went
I were a baby still. I love you better.
I will about it straight;
I will appeach the villain.
I will appear, and fight.
I will attend her here,
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I will away towards Barnet presently,
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
I will be correspondent to command
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
I will be his conduct.
I will be married to a wealthy widow,
I will be master of what is mine own:
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
I will be squared by this. I do believe
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
I will be very kind, and liberal
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
I will confess to you that I love him.
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I will converse with iron-witted fools
I will despair, and be at enmity
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
I will discharge thee.
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
I will follow you.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
I will give you the minstrel.
I will go darkly to work with her.
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
I will go wash;
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
I will not be the executioner.
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
I will not dine until I see the same.
I will not do't.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
I will not ruinate my father's house,
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
I will not sup to-night.
I will not trust you, sir.
I will omit no opportunity
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
I will prove so, sir, to my power.
I will resist such entertainment till
I will resolve your grace immediately.
I will respect thee as a father if
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
I will some other be, some Florentine,
I will stand betwixt you and danger.
I will take order for her keeping close.
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
I will tell you
I will then give it you soundly.
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
I will with all expedient duty see you:
I will with you, if you be so contented,
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
I will, my lord.
I will, my lord.
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
I willingly obey your command.
I wis it is not half way to her heart;
I wis your grandam had a worser match.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
I wish no better
I wish you now, then;
I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
I would Friar Peter--
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
I would I knew thy heart.
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
I would I were thy bird.
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
I would adventure for such merchandise.
I would appeach him.
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
I would attach you all and make you stoop
I would be so triumphant as I am?
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
I would dissemble with my nature where
I would do more than that, if more were needful.
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
I would have had you put your power well on,
I would he had continued to his country
I would he had.
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
I would most gladly know the issue of it.
I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
I would not be a stander-by to hear
I would not for the wealth of all the town
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
I would not spend another such a night,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
I would the fool were married to her grave!
I would the gods had nothing else to do
I would there were no age between sixteen and
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
I would they were abed!
I would they were barbarians--as they are,
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
I would they were, that I might die at once;
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
I would to God that the inclusive verge
I would to God, my lords, he might be found:
I would to heaven I had your potency,
I would wish me only he.
I would with such perfection govern, sir,
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
I would you had been by the ship side, to have
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
I would your duty were as foolish too:
I would your highness would depart the field:
I would your spirit were easier for advice,
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
I yield all this;
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
I' fecks!
I' the absence of the needer.
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
I' the boldness of your speech.
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
I' the city of kites and crows.
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
I' the name of me--
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I' the plain way of his merit.
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
I' the way of flattery further.
I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
I'ld not have show'd it.
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
I'ld with thee every foot.
I'll after him, and see the event of this.
I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
I'll be his surety.
I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
I'll blush you thanks.
I'll bring him to you.
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
I'll buckler thee against a million.
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
I'll buy him of you.
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
I'll do his country service.
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
I'll do't, my lord.
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
I'll draw the curtain:
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
I'll fa you; do you note me?
I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
I'll find about the making of the bed;
I'll follow instantly.
I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
I'll follow you, and tell what answer
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
I'll give my reasons,
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
I'll gladly learn.
I'll go along with you.
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
I'll ha' thee burnt.
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
I'll have no wife, Paulina.
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
I'll hear you by and by.
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
I'll join with black despair against my soul,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.
I'll keep you company. Will you along?
I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
I'll know
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
I'll make all speed.
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
I'll never pause again, never stand still,
I'll no gainsaying.
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
I'll not endure him.
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
I'll not put
I'll not remember you of my own lord,
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
I'll pheeze you, in faith.
I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
I'll privily away. I love the people,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
I'll send him certain word of my success.
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
I'll show't the king and undertake to be
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
I'll steal away.
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
I'll swear for 'em.
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
I'll tell him of you.
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
I'll throw thy body in another room
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
I'll to my rest.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
I'll to the king; and signify to him
I'll to the queen: please you,
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
I'll undertake 't:
I'll undertake to land them on our coast
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
I'll wait upon your honour.
I'll wait upon your lordship.
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'
I'll win our ancient right in France again,
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
I'm out of patience.
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
I, sir! ne'er a whit.
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
I, then in London keeper of the king,
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
I.

If I fly, Marcius,
If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
If I may counsel you, some day or two
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
If I pervert your course. Who's here?
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
If I would yield him my virginity,
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--
If Warwick be so near as men report.
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
If any be, the trespass of the queen.
If any in Vienna be of worth
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
If any spark of life be yet remaining,
If any such be here--as God forbid!--
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
If at home, sir,
If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
If by the way they be not fought withal.
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
If case some one of you would fly from us,
If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would

If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
If either of you both love Katharina,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
If ever he have wife, let her he made
If ever you disturb our streets again,
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength

If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
If he be credulous and trust my tale,
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
If he had been as you and you as he,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.
If he should still malignantly remain
If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
If he were dead, what would betide of me?
If he were known alive?
If he were putting to my house the brand
If he were seated as King Edward is.

If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
If murdering innocents be executing,

If not, how best to bear it.
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.

If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
If she dares trust me with her little babe,
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
If she did know me one. Away with her!
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
If she had not a spirit to resist.
If she have time to breathe be well assured
If she pertain to life let her speak too.
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
If sorrow can admit society,
If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
If that be right which Warwick says is right,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
If that my cousin king be King of England,
If that our noble father be alive?
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:

If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.
If they set down before 's, for the remove
If they were his assistants, yea or no;
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
If this be magic, let it be an art
If this be nothing.
If this foul deed were by to equal it:
If this inducement force her not to love,
If this might be a brother.
If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
If thou be merciful,
If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,

If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,

If we would have you.

If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

If you accept them, then their worth is great.
If you advise it.
If you affect him, sister, here I swear
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
If you be king, why should not I succeed?
If you be maid or no?
If you be one, as you are well express'd
If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.
If you do fight against your country's foes,
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
If you do free your children from the sword,
If you do hold the same intent wherein
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

If you would not so,
If you would seek us,
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,

Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
Imagine I have said farewell already.
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Immediately we do exile him hence:
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
In Brittany, received intelligence
In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
In God's name, what art thou?
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
In London streets, that coronation-day,
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
In acclamations hyperbolical;
In action all of precept, he did show me
In all her best array bear her to church:
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
In all this presence that hath moved me so.
In all which time you and your husband Grey
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
In any proportion or in any language.
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
In aught he merit not.
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
In being Coriolanus.
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
In bolted language; meal and bran together
In braving arms against thy sovereign.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
In brief, to set the needless process by,
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
In deadly hate the one against the other:
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
In deep designs and matters of great moment,
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
In every borough as we pass along;
In every county as we go along.
In every mess have folly and the feeders
In every one of these no man is free,
In execution.
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
In following this usurping Henry.
In gait and countenance surely like a father.
In good time.
In gross rebellion and detested treason:
In half an hour she promised to return.
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
In hateful practise. First, his integrity
In heaps and piles of ruin.
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
In her consists my happiness and thine;
In her imagined person.
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
In him that did object the same to thee;
In him there is a hope of government,
In him, a royal prince, and many moe
In his behalf.
In his tongue.
In honour follows Coriolanus.
In human action and capacity,
In humours like the people of this world,
In ignorant concealment.
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
In levity: since which time of five years
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
In love?
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
In many singularities; but we saw not
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
In music, instruments and poetry,
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
In our first way.
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
In our well-found successes, to report
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
In peace what each of them by the other lose,
In peace, to his utmost peril.
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
In peril of precipitation
In peril to incur your former malady,
In praises sauced with lies.
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
In puny battle slay me.
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
In resolution as I swore before.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
In secret ambush on the forest side
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
In sign of league and amity with thee:
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.
In sign of what you are, not to reward
In so entitling me, and no less honest
In some large measure to thy father's death,
In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
In special business from his holiness.
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
In such a business.
In such a gorgeous palace!
In such a one as, you consenting to't,
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
In supplication nod: and my young boy
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
In that I live and for that will I die.
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
In that good path that I would wish it go,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
In that there's comfort.
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
In that which seems so.
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
In the delaying death.
In the devotion of a subject's love,
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
In the remembrance of a weeping queen.
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
In the seat royal of this famous isle?
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
In them I trust; for they are soldiers,
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
In this just suit come I to move your grace.
In this our fabric, if that they--
In this point charge him home, that he affects
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
In this so sudden business.
In this the heaven figures some event.
In this which you accuse her.
In this your cousin's death.
In those foundations which I build upon,
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
In token of which duty, if he please,
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
In very good time: speak not you to him till we
In war was never lion raged more fierce,
In weeping after this untimely bier.
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
In what I further shall intend to do,
In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
In what vile part of this anatomy
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
In wholesome manner.
In whom already he's well graced, can not
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
In your close patience.
In your condemned seconds.
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.
In, in, in, in!
Incapable and shallow innocents,
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
Inclinable to honour and advance
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
Indeed I would be consul.
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
Indeed, madam?
Indeed, my lord,
Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
Indeed, you shall not.
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
Infected as her life, she would not live
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
Inferring arguments of mighty force.
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
Injurious Margaret!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!
Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
Insisting on the old prerogative
Insolent villain!
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Instead whereof let this supply the room:
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
Intended or committed was this fault?
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
Intends to appear before the people, hoping
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Intents but merely thoughts.
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
Into an auger's bore.
Into destruction cast him.
Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
Into something rich and strange.
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
Is all the grace I beg.
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
Is all unpossible.
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
Is as a fury to torment my soul;
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
Is but a little way above our heads,
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
Is dead.
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Is death to any he that utters them.
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
Is he come?
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
Is he won yet?
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
Is it even so? rewards he my true service
Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Is it good den?
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Is it new and old too? how may that be?
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
Is it not strange and strange?
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
Is it not yours?
Is it true too, think you?
Is it true, think you?
Is it upon record, or else reported
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Is lechery so look'd after?
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
Is like a good thing, being often read,
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
Is more than one,
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Is my dear son with such sour company:
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
Is near the hate of those love not the king.
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
Is not here passable.
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Is not infected: but if one present
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Is not your father grown incapable
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
Is nothing left me but my body's length.
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.
Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
Is of a king become a banish'd man,
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,
Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Is richly noted and here justified
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
Is she a Capulet?
Is she become the suitor?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
Is she your cousin?
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
Is spotless reputation: that away,
Is still a dying horror!
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
Is that an answer?
Is that she is intolerable curst
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
Is the day so young?
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Is the obedience to a master, one
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
Is there no manners left among maids? will they
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
Is there no remedy?
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
Is this Menenius?
Is this done?
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
Is this the daughter of a king?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Is this the promise that you made your mother?
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Is thy name Tyrrel?
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Is to become her husband and her father:
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
Is too much for a score,
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
Is very good meat in lent
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
Is whispering nothing?
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Is't a verdict?
Is't lawful, pray you,
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
Is't possible you will away to-night?
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Is't so, indeed.
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
Is, to determine of the coronation.
Isabel,
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
It be to do thee service.
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
It becomes thy oath full well,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
It boots thee not to be compassionate:
It burneth in the Capel's monument.
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
It cannot be avoided but by this;
It cannot be.
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
It cannot fail but by
It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
It follows in his thought that I am he.
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
It honour'd him.
It is Lord Angelo.
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
It is a bitter deputy.
It is a comforter.
It is a kind of history.
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
It is a matter of small consequence,
It is a mind
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
It is a surplus of your grace, which never
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
It is an honour that I dream not of.
It is apart
It is but needful:
It is determined, not concluded yet:
It is enough I may but call her mine.
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
It is in mine authority to command
It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
It is my son, young Harry Percy,
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
It is no sin at all, but charity.
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
It is not my consent,
It is not truer he is Angelo
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
It is now apparent?
It is required
It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
It is the humane way: the other course
It is the issue of Polixenes:
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
It is the quality o' the climate.
It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
It is too little, helping him to all;
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
It is true.
It is war's prize to take all vantages;
It is your former promise.
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
It is yours;
It is, and wants but nomination.
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is, my lord.
It is, my lord.
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!
It is: may it be done?
It is; you lie, you lie:
It issues from the rancour of a villain,
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
It may be so; but yet my inward soul
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
It may not be.
It must and shall be so: content thyself.
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
It must be great that can inherit us
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
It rains downright.
It rested in your grace
It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
It shall be so, it shall be so.
It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
It shall be so.
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
It shall be speeded well.
It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
It shall be to him then as our good wills,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
It should be look'd to: come.
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
It stands in like request?
It stands your grace upon to do him right.
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
It then remains
It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
It was a bare petition of a state
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
It was an answer: how apply you this?
It was commanded so.
It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
It was i' the offering!
It was my folly; if industriously
It was the friar of orders grey,
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
It were a shame to let this land by lease;
It were dishonour to deny it her.
It were impossible I should speed amiss.
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
It will be pastime passing excellent,
It will let in and out the enemy
It will not be avoided but by this.
It will outrun you, father, in the end.
It will the woefullest division prove
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
It's nine o'clock.
It's supper-time, my lord;
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime

James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
Join with the present sickness that I have;
Join'd in commission with him; but either
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
Jove send her
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
Judge.
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Juliet, the county stays.
Julietta with child.
Just as my master had direction:
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
Justice design the victor's chivalry.
Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard

Katharina the curst!
Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Keep house and port and servants as I should:
Keep law and form and due proportion,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
Keeper:
Keeper:
Keeper:
Keeper:
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Kills for faults of his own liking!
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
Know thus far forth.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
Know you this woman?
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Know, I pray you,--
Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Know, good mother,
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Known and allied to yours.
Knows he of this?
Knows not that ever he knew me.
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,

La you now, you hear:
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Lady:
Lady:
Lady:
Lady:
Lady:
Lady:
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
Lament till I am lost.
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
Lawful as eating.
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Lay
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
Lay hands upon him.
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
Lay it by too: another.
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
Lay't so to his charge:
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
Leave us to cure this cause.
Leave your prating: since these good men are
Lechery?
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Left I his title out.
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Lend favourable ears to our request;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
Lend thine ear.
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Lesser his person than an ill report;
Lest I might be too rash:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Lest in our need he might infect another
Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
Lest she should be denied.
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
Let be, let be.
Let but your honour know,
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Let go.
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Let him alone;
Let him be apprehended.
Let him be call'd for.
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
Let him be sent for.
Let him be whipt and hang'd.
Let him depart before we need his help.
Let him die for't.
Let him know't.
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
Let him that was the cause of this have power
Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
Let it command a mirror hither straight,
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Let me desire your company: he must come,
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
Let me entreat you speak the former language.
Let me entreat you.
Let me entreat you.
Let me entreat, for I command no more,
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
Let me have open means to come to them,
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Let me know the point.
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
Let me speak:
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
Let the first budger die the other's slave,
Let the high office and the honour go
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Let them assemble,
Let them go on;
Let them hang.
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
Let them have scope: though what they do impart
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Let them not live to taste this land's increase
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Let this be done.
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
Let us assail the family of York.
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Let us survey the vantage of the field
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
Let's all sink with the king.
Let's along.
Let's be calm.
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
Let's each one send unto his wife;
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
Let's ha't, good Grumio.
Let's have some merry ones.
Let's have that, good sir.
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
Let's hence, and hear
Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
Let's make the best of it.
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,
Let's not meet her.
Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
Let's take leave of him.
Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Let's to the Capitol;
Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
Lets along.
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
Lieutenant:
Lieutenant:
Lieutenant:
Lieutenant:
Lieutenant:
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
Like a dull actor now,
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
Like a good parent, did beget of him
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
Like an unseasonable stormy day,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
Like man new made.
Like men born to renown by life or death.
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
Like one that stands upon a promontory,
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
Like softest music to attending ears!
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
Like to my followers in prosperity,
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
Like very sanctity, she did approach
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
Limit each leader to his several charge,
Limps after in base imitation.
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
Little are we beholding to your love,
Little have you to say
Little.
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
Live, and thrive!
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Lives my sweet son?
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Living to time.
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
Long live Edward the Fourth!
Long live Gonzalo!
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
Long live Richard, England's royal king!
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
Longer to live most weary, and present
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
Look behind you, my lord.
Look for no less than death.
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
Look forward on the journey you shall go.
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
Look that you take upon you as you should;
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Look to the drawbridge there!
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Look where he comes.
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
Look you speak justly.
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
Look'd wondering each at other.
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
Look, and thou shalt see.
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
Look, look! O heavy day!
Look, sir, your mother!
Look, sir.
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?

Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Love loving not itself none other can.
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
Love they to live that love and honour have.
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Love you the man that wrong'd you?
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
Loved me above the measure of a father;
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?
Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
Lucentio, gentle sir.

Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
Madam!
Madam, 'tis now in tune.
Madam, I am here.
Madam, I am not well.
Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
Madam, I'll sing.
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
Madam, before you touch the instrument,
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Madam, farewell.
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
Madam, if you could find out but a man
Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
Madam, my instrument's in tune.
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Madam, we will attend your grace.
Madam, we'll dance.
Madam, we'll play at bowls.
Madam, we'll tell tales.
Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
Madam, with all my heart.
Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Madam.
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
Made all of false-faced soothing!
Made by some other deity than nature,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
Maiden, no remedy.
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Make haste, I say.
Make haste, make haste.
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
Make me to think so twenty years together!
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Make that thy question, and go rot!
Make the prize light.
Make the sun dance. Hark you!
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Make way, unruly woman!
Make your best haste, and go not
Make yourselves scabs?
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
Makes me most forward in this noble presence
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
Makes the survivor heir of all.
Makes you think so.
Making another head to fight again.
Making both it unable for itself,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Making practise on the times,
Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
Making the mother, wife and child to see
Making them women of good carriage:
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Manifest treason!
Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
Many a battle have I won in France,
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
Many for many virtues excellent,
Many good morrows to my noble lord!
Many that are not mad
Many years of happy days befal
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
March on, my fellows:
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
March to assault thy country than to tread--
March'd through the city to the palace gates.
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
Marcius coming home!
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Marcius!
Marcius,
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their

Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,

Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the

Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
Master of this design, did give us, with
Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
Master, for my hand,
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
Master, it is no time to chide you now;
Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?
Master, some show to welcome us to town.
Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
Master:
Master:
Masterly done:
Masters o' the people,
Masters of the people,
Masters, lay down your weapons.
Match not the high perfection of my loss:
Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
May I change these garments?
May be a precedent and witness good
May be possessed with some store of crowns;
May be put from her by society:
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
May deem that you are worthily deposed.
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
May give you thankful sacrifice.
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.
May it please your highness to resolve me now;
May know if you remain upon this island;
May make against the house of Lancaster.
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
May not one speak?
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
May show her duty and make known her love?'
May show like all yourself.
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
May these same instruments, which you profane,
May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
May think anon it moves.
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
May well abate the over-merry spleen
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
May your grace speak of it?
Mayor:
Mayor:
Mayor:
Me and thy crying self.
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
Me shall you find ready and willing
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
Me too, let me go thither.
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Meaning, to court'sy.
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
Meantime, have patience.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Measure for measure must be answered.
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
Men judge by the complexion of the sky
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
Mended again. The matter; proceed.
Menenius ever, ever.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
Merely awry: when he did love his country,
Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
Merely, my lord.
Merry or sad shall't be?

Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
Methinks a father
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
Methinks thou speak'st not well.
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
Methought I had; and often did I strive
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Might come to me again. Who's there?
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
Might have found easy fines: but there to end
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
Might stop our countryman.
Might there not be a charity in sin
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
Mine arms about that body, where against
Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Mine enemy has more power.
Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
Mine own desert.
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
Mistress Overdone.
Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Mistress, how mean you that?
Mistress, we have.
Mistress, what cheer?
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
Monday, my lord,
Money's a medler.
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
More after our commandment than as guided
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
More bitterly could I expostulate,
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
More cruel to your good report than grateful
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
More fearful, is deliver'd.
More fierce and more inexorable far
More fit to do another such offence
More free than he is jealous.
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
More health and happiness betide my liege
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
More nor less to others paying
More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
More rich for what they yielded.
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
More straining on for plucking back, not following
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
More than a wild exposture to each chance
More than his singularity, he goes
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
More than mistress of
More than my body's parting with my soul!
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
More than our brother is our chastity.
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
More than the infant that is born to-night
More than the instant army we can make,
More than the nature of a brother's love!
More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
More than with parting from my lord the king.
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
More to know
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
More widows in them of this business' making
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
More worth than any man; men, that she is
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
Most bounteous sir,
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
Most holy sir, I thank you.
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
Most mighty sovereign,
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
Most noble sir,
Most noble sir,
Most notedly, sir.
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
Most ponderous and substantial things!
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
Most sure, the goddess
Most sweet voices!
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Most welcome!
Most willingly;
Most worthy madam,
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
Move them no more by crossing their high will.
Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
Mum.
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
Murdering impossibility, to make
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
Music, awake her; strike!
Musician:
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!
Must I do so? and must I ravel out
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
Must I then do't to them?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
Must all determine here?
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
Must he needs die?
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
Must needs appear offence.
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
Mutually.
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
My Lord of Norfolk,--
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
My Lord!
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
My affections
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.
My best and freshest men; served his designments
My best beloved and approved friend,
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
My blemishes in them, and so still think of
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
My body shall make good upon this earth,
My body up to shame.
My books and instruments shall be my company,
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
My brave spirit!
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
My brother Montague shall post to London:
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
My brother did love Juliet,
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
My brother was too careless of his charge.
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
My business is a word or two with Claudio.
My business, sir, is to the king.
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
My care is loss of care, by old care done;
My careless father fondly gave away'?
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
My charity is outrage, life my shame
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
My country's good with a respect more tender,
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
My dainty duck, my dear-a?
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
My daughter Katharina is to be married:
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
My dear?
My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
My evils conjured to remembrance and
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
My fan, Peter.
My father Capulet will have it so;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
My father came untimely to his death?
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
My father hath a power; inquire of him
My father of this business.
My father will grant precious things as trifles.
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
My father's death--
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
My father's of a better nature, sir,
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
My first son.
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
My fortunes to your service, which are here
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
My good Camillo,
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
My gracious lady, go;
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
My gracious lord,
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
My gracious lord, here in the parliament
My gracious lord,--
My gracious silence, hail!
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
My gracious sovereign?
My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
My gracious uncle--
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
My grandam told me he was murdered there.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
My haste may not admit it;
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
My hazards still have been your solace: and
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
My heart is not confederate with my hand.
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
My holy sir, none better knows than you
My horse to yours, no.
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
My ladies both, good day to you.
My land amounts not to so much in all:
My language! heavens!
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
My leash unwillingly.
My legs can keep no measure in delight,
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lessons make no music in three parts.
My liberty.
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.
My liege, one word.
My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
My life and services.
My life may last to answer.
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
My life were better ended by their hate,
My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
My lord Sebastian,
My lord and husband!
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
My lord it shall be done.
My lord of Ely!
My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
My lord protector needs will have it so.
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
My lord the king, the king!
My lord!
My lord!
My lord!
My lord's almost so far transported that
My lord,
My lord,
My lord,
My lord,
My lord,
My lord,
My lord, 'tis but begun.
My lord, 'tis nothing.
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.
My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
My lord, he doth deny to come.
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
My lord, in the base court he doth attend
My lord, most villanously; believe it.
My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
My lord, there needs no such apology:
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
My lord, we'll do it throughly.
My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
My lord, will't please you pass along?
My lord, will't please you to fall to?
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
My lord, your son was gone before I came.
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
My lord,--
My lord.
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
My lord?
My lord?
My lord?
My lord?
My lord?
My lord?
My lord?
My lords of England, let me tell you this:
My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
My lords, before it pleased his majesty
My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.
My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
My marvel and my message. To your court
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
My master's.
My mate, that's never to be found again,
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
My mind will never grant what I perceive
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
My name be blotted from the book of life,
My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
My native English, now I must forego:
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
My noble masters, hear me speak.
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
My only love sprung from my only hate!
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
My part thereof that I have done to her.
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
My people did expect my hence departure
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
My poverty, but not my will, consents.
My power? Alas, I doubt--
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
My prettiest Perdita!
My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
My princely father then had wars in France
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
My rage is gone;
My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
My revenge properly, my remission lies
My royal father, cheer these noble lords
My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
My soul the father; and these two beget
My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
My strong imagination sees a crown
My subjects for a pair of carved saints
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
My swift command, though I with death and with
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
My title's good, and better far than his.
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
My true Paulina,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
My trusty servant, well approved in all,
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--
My will to her consent is but a part;
My women may be with me; for you see
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
My words disbench'd you not.
My words express my purpose.
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Myself condemned and myself excused.
Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Myself disposed to sleep.
Myself have often heard him say and swear
Myself in person will straight follow you.
Myself thus alter'd with 't.
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
Myself to see the issue.
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,

Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,

Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,

Nay, I dare not swear it.

Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
Nay, I will win my wager better yet
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
Nay, and you shall hear some.
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,

Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
Nay, come, sit down; then on.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
Nay, go not from us thus.
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge

Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:

Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.

Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
Near to the king in blood, and near in love
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
Neglect the visitation of my friends.
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
Neighbours, God speed!
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
Neither, my lord.
Neither.
Neither.
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
Never crave him; we are definitive.
Never did captive with a freer heart
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
Never till then.
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Never to marry but by my free leave?
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
Never was seen so black a day as this:
Never, O never shall I see more joy!
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!
Never, but once.
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
Never?
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
Nicanor? no.
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
No better.
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
No cause!
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.
No countermand; no such example have we:
No court in Europe is too good for thee;
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
No doubt, my lord.
No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
No foot shall stir.
No good at all that I can do for him;
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
No harm.
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
No humble suitors press to speak for right,
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
No impediment between, but that you must
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
No less importing than our general good,
No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
No longer session hold upon my shame,
No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
No longer stay.
No longer staying but to give the mother
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
No man but prophesied revenge for it.
No man knows whither.
No marrying 'mong his subjects?
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
No matter, then, who see it;
No matter: get thee gone,
No might nor greatness in mortality
No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
No more evasion:
No more infected with my country's love
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
No more than were I painted I would wish
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
No more words, we beseech you.
No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
No more, but that you read
No more.
No news so bad abroad as this at home;
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
No noise, my lord; but needful conference
No occupation; all men idle, all;
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
No public benefit which you receive
No quarrel, but a slight contention.
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
No remedy.
No richer than his honour: how he glisters
No settled senses of the world can match
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
No sovereignty;--
No such jade as you, if me you mean.
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
No truly sir; not a penny.
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
No wonder, sir;
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
No word to save thee.
No worse than I, upon some agreement
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
No! why?  When he that is my husband now
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
No, Caius Marcius;
No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
No, I can better play the orator.
No, I serve not thy master.
No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
No, I'll die here.
No, I'll none of you.
No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
No, I'll not meddle.
No, I'll not rear
No, Pompey.
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
No, as I am a man.
No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
No, boy.
No, but the loss of his own royal person.
No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
No, by my life.
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
No, by my troth, my lord.
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
No, coz, I rather weep.
No, first let's reason with him.
No, for then we should be colliers.
No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
No, good sir;
No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
No, he must not.
No, holy father; throw away that thought;
No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
No, in good earnest.
No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
No, indeed.
No, it begins again.
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
No, madam.
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
No, marry; I fear thee!
No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.
No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
No, my good lord.
No, my good lord;
No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.
No, my good lord; it was by private message.
No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
No, my lord, I'll fight.
No, my lord.
No, my lord.
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
No, no, he's gone.
No, no, men living flatter those that die.
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
No, no, my lord.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no: but all this did I know before.
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
No, no; no man saw 'em.
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
No, not so much perdition as an hair
No, not that name was given me at the font,
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
No, not these twenty years.
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
No, pray thee.
No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
No, sir, nor I mean it not.
No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
No, sir.
No, sir: yet oft,
No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
No, take more:
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
No, to the dignity and height of honour
No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
No;
No;
No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
No; for he could not so resign his crown
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
No; if I mistake
No; if without more words you will get you hence.
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
No? a dozen times at least.
No? you say your husband.
Noble Aufidius,
Noble Marcius!
Noble Menenius,
Noble Sebastian,
Noble lady!
Noble lords,
Noble prince,
Noble tribunes,
Nobleman:
None but for some and yet all different.
None else of name and noble estimate.
None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
None rare, my lord.
None should come at him.
None that I more love than myself. You are a
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
None, but that there is so great a fever on
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
None, since the curfew rung.
None, sir, none.
None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
Nor I nor any man that but man is
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
Nor I, nor any
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
Nor I.
Nor I.
Nor I.
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
Nor did you think it folly
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
Nor ever will be ruled.
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Nor how to be contented with one wife,
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.
Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
Nor never by advised purpose meet
Nor never look upon each other's face;
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
Nor none that live, I hope.
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
Nor read the secrets in't.
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
Nor yoke with him for tribune.
Nor you, as we are, loyal.
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
Not I, my lord.
Not I:
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Not Isabel?
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
Not a hair perish'd;
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
Not a soul
Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
Not able to endure the sight of day,
Not able to produce more accusation
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Not any yet:
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
Not at all, good lady:
Not better than he, by her own report.
Not body's death, but body's banishment.
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
Not dropp'd down yet.
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
Not for because
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Not having the power to do the good it would,
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
Not in a grave,
Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
Not in this heat, sir, now.
Not knowing how to find the open air,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Not like to me, or any of my kin,
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
Not now, not now.
Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Not of this country, though my chance is now
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
Not out of doors!
Not poison any further.
Not possible.
Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
Not separated with the racking clouds,
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
Not sick, although I have to do with death,
Not since widow Dido's time.
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
Not so big as a round little worm
Not so hot, good sir:
Not so well apparell'd
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Not so:
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
Not that I know.
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Not to them all.
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Not unlike,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
Not willing any longer conference,
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
Not within, sir.
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Not yet, I thee beseech:
Not your gaoler, then,
Not?
Note me this, good friend;
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
Nothing but his report.
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
Nothing but that; move still, still so,
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
Nothing may give us aid.
Nothing of him that doth fade
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Noting this penury, to myself I said
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
Now God in heaven forbid!
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
Now I arise:
Now I come to't my lord
Now I fear thee not:
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
Now Jove afford you cause!
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
Now am I seated as my soul delights,
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
Now are they come.
Now be you blest for it!
Now blessed be the great Apollo!
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.
Now cheer each other in each other's love
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
Now is the day we long have looked for:
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Now is the winter of our discontent
Now is this golden crown like a deep well
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.
Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
Now must I hide his body in some hole,
Now must I to the monument alone;
Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
Now one the better, then another best;
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
Now the condition.
Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Now the gods keep you!
Now the good gods forbid
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
Now thou'rt troublesome.
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Now we have shown our power,
Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
Now will I in, to take some privy order,
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
Now, by the world--
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
Now, fellow,
Now, fellows, you are welcome.
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;
Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
Now, good Camillo;
Now, good my lord,
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
Now, good sir,
Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
Now, if you love me, stay.
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
Now, in good time!
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
Now, messenger, what letters or what news
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
Now, my fair'st friend,
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
Now, sir, to you.
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
Now, sister, what's the comfort?
Now, the gods crown thee!
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Now, what's the matter. Provost?
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
Now, where's my wife?
Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Nurse!
Nurse! What should she do here?
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I

O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
O Doricles,
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
O God's lady dear!
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
O God, she comes!
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
O Hermione,
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
O Marcius, Marcius!
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
O Paulina,
O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
O Tullus,--
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O bitter consequence,
O blessed heavens!
O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
O bloody Richard! miserable England!
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
O cousin, cousin!
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
O dear father,
O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
O general,
O gentle villain, do not turn away!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
O gracious duke,
O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
O hear me, Isabella!
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
O heavens!
O heavens! O heavens!
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
O heavens! it cannot be.
O heavens! what stuff is here
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
O heavy times, begetting such events!
O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
O honey nurse, what news?
O how that name befits my composition!
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O just but severe law!
O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
O lady Fortune,
O lamentable day!
O lamentable day!
O let no noble eye profane a tear
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
O loyal father of a treacherous son!
O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
O master, master, I have watch'd so long
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
O me, O me! My child, my only life,
O me, the gods!
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
O miserable lady! But, for me,
O miserable thought! and more unlikely
O momentary grace of mortal men,
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
O mother, mother!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
O my brother,
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
O my dear lord,
O my dread lord,
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
O my liege,
O my lord!
O my most gracious lord,
O my most sacred lady!
O my poor father!
O my sweet lady, pardon.
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
O noble fellow!
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
O noble prince, I can discover all
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
O sir, you are not right: have you not known
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
O sweet Paulina,
O that I had him,
O that I were a mockery king of snow,
O that ever I was born!
O that he were alive, and here beholding
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O that you could!
O the gods!
O the heavens!
O the heavens!
O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
O this learning, what a thing it is!
O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
O true apothecary!
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
O woful day, O woful day!
O woful time!
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
O worthy duke,
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
O you beast!
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
O,
O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
O, God ye god-den.
O, I am fortune's fool!
O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
O, I am slain!
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
O, a cherubim
O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
O, ay, what else?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
O, but remember this another day,
O, but they say the tongues of dying men
O, but, sir,
O, by this count I shall be much in years
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
O, doubt not that;
O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
O, fie, fie, fie!
O, fie, fie, fie!
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
O, full of careful business are his looks!
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
O, give me pardon,
O, good madam, there can be none yet.
O, good sir, I do.
O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
O, good sir, tenderly, O!
O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
O, he is even in my mistress' case,
O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
O, ho! entreat her!
O, how I long to have some chat with her!
O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
O, if a virgin,
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
O, if you raise this house against this house,
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
O, is it so? But why commands the king
O, kill me too!
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
O, let him marry her.
O, let me clip ye
O, let me make the period to my curse!
O, let me pray before I take my death!
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
O, let me speak!
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
O, may such purple tears be alway shed
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
O, my heart bleeds
O, my heart!
O, no more, no more!
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
O, no! the apprehension of the good
O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, no, no, no.
O, not by much.
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
O, patience!
O, peace! the friar is come.
O, peace, Paulina!
O, pity, God, this miserable age!
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
O, she knew well
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
O, she that might have intercepted thee,
O, she's warm!
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
O, sir, sir, sir,
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
O, sir, you are deceived.
O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
O, stand up blest!
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
O, teach me how I should forget to think.
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
O, that a mighty man of such descent,
O, that it were as like as it is true!
O, that must be
O, that once more you knew but what you are!
O, that she knew she were!
O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
O, that your young nobility could judge
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
O, then my best blood turn
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
O, they are at it!
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
O, true-bred!
O, very well; I have perused the note.
O, was she so? I must
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.
O, well begg'd!
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
O, were it but my life,
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
O, what may man within him hide,
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
O, whither?
O, who can hold a fire in his hand
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
O, woe the day!
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
O, you have made good work!
O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
O,'tis Marcius!

Obedience bids I should not bid again.
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
Observed his courtship to the common people;
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
Of Mantua.
Of Marcius?
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
Of a despised life closed in my breast
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
Of all encertainties himself commended,
Of all mad matches never was the like.
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Of all professors else, make proselytes
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Of all the voices that we have procured
Of all the world I loved and to him put
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
Of any point in't shall not only be
Of any thing the image tell me that
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Of burning Rome.
Of burning youth.
Of capital treason we arrest you here.
Of celebration of that nuptial which
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
Of disobedient opposition
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
Of either, madam.
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
Of every wind that blows.
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
Of government the properties to unfold,
Of gracious order, late come from the See
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
Of greater sums than I have promised.
Of happy holding her.
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
Of his bones are coral made;
Of his bright passage to the occident.
Of his demerits rob Cominius.
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
Of his most sovereign name; consider little
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Of love between your daughter and himself:
Of love?
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
Of much less value is my company
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
Of my lord general.
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Of my success.
Of my young play-fellow.
Of necessary fitness?
Of neither, girl:
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
Of noble blood in this declining land.
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
Of one I danced withal.
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
Of our most gracious mistress.
Of our own power: what think you of it?
Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
Of outward order: this we came not to,
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Of pity, not revenge!
Of present death.
Of prey that keep upon't.
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Of sorrow or of joy?
Of sprites and goblins.
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
Of such as have before endured the like.
Of such possessions and so high esteem,
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Of that integrity which should become't,
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
Of that there's none, or little.
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
Of the all-building law; and that there were
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
Of the king's ship
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
Of the queen's speed, is gone.
Of the salt deep,
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
Of the whole dungy earth.
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Of their breath only!
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
Of trembling winter, the fairest
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
Of what degree soever, with his brother.
Of what is past.
Of what is to be dreaded.
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
Of what lies heavy to't.
Of what that want might ruin.
Of what we chance to sentence.
Of what you promised me.
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Of whence are you?
Of who she but bid follow.
Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
Of you that yet are well.
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
Of your commissions.
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
Of your great danger.
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
Off with his head, and set it on York gates;
Off with his son George's head!
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
Offended us you have not, but the king.
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,

Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
Oh, he is young and his minority
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
Oh, poor Clarence!
Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Old sir, I know
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
On Thursday next be married to this county.
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
On a dissension of a doit, break out
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
On both sides more respect.
On equal terms to give him chastisement?
On fair ground
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On pain of death, no person be so bold
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
On pain to be found false and recreant,
On pain to be found false and recreant,
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
On some apparent danger seen in him
On some known ground of treachery in him?
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
On the sudden,
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
On them to took and practise by myself.
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
On this young man, for learning and behavior
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
On what condition stands it and wherein?
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
On whom depending, their obedience fails
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
On yon proud man, should take it off again
On you or yours,
On your allegiance,
On your command.
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
On, good Camillo.
On, to the Capitol!
On: those that think it is unlawful business
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Once more to look on him.
Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
Once more, take her hence.
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
Once more, what news?
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
One jot of ceremony.
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
One of our convent, and his confessor,
One of our order, to associate me,
One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
One of them you shall be.
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
One of these is true:
One of these two must be necessities,
One on 's father's moods.
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
One seven-night longer.
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
One that hath ever been God's enemy:
One that made means to come by what he hath,
One that speaks thus their voice?
One that you love.
One that, above all other strifes, contended
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
One thus descended,
One time will owe another.
One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
One word more, one word.
One word more; I charge thee
One word, good citizens.
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
One: tell.
Only fair speech.
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
Only for propagation of a dower
Only for saying he would make his son
Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
Only make trial what your love can do
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
Only their ends
Only to stick it in their children's sight
Only, good master, while we do admire
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Oppose against their wills.
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
Or I my life.
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Or a half-moon made with a pen.
Or all or lose his hire.
Or all will fall in broil.
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
Or any other ground inhabitable,
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Or as the south to the septentrion.
Or as thy father and his father did,
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
Or blessed was't we did?
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
Or butchers killing flies.
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Or by the father there were none at all;
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Or did he make the jest against his will?
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
Or die renowned by attempting it.
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
Or docks, or mallows.
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Or else be impudently negative,
Or else beshrew them both.
Or else come after: I'll away before.
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
Or else for ever be confixed here,
Or else he must not only die the death,
Or else he never would compare between.
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
Or else thou diest to-morrow.
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
Or else you like not of my company.
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.
Or from the all that are took something good,
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Or hollowly put on.
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
Or how stolen from the dead.
Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Or if of grief, being altogether had,
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Or in his emmence that fills it up,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
Or is the adder better than the eel,
Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
Or lace for your cape,
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
Or let me die, to look on death no more!
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Or let us stand to our authority,
Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
Or manage it to part these men with me.
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Or never after look me in the face:
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Or not remember what I must be now!
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Or shall we on without a apology?
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
Or stronger for your need.
Or than for strength and safety of our country.
Or that I could forget what I have been,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Or that we would, against the form of law,
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Or to their own perdition.
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Or wallow naked in December snow
Or what is now received: I witness to
Or what is worst will follow.
Or what you will command me will I do,
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.
Or whether 'twas report of her success;
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
Or whether that the body public be
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Or with the clamorous report of war
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
Or wrath or craft may get him.
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!
Or, being open, put into his hands
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
Or, if she be accused in true report,
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
Our Perdita is found.
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Our Rome will cast upon thee.
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.
Our army's in the field
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
Our city's institutions, and the terms
Our comfort in the country. We must find
Our contract celebrated.
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
Our doubts are traitors
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
Our fair appointments may be well perused.
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
Our fine musician groweth amorous.
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
Our greatest friends attend us.
Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
Our people and our peers are both misled,
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our sorrow with our comfort.
Our spoils he kick'd at,
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
Our swifter composition.
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.
Our uncle York lord governor of England;
Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our whole city is much bound to him.
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Out of his charity, being then appointed
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
Out of thy garments.
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
Out on her, hilding!
Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
Out three years old.
Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
Out upon you! what a man are you!
Out!
Out, alas!
Out, devil! I remember them too well:
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Out--
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
Owe and succeed thy weakness.
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,

Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
Pardon it;
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
Pardon me, noble lord:
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
Pardon, dear father.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
Pardon, madam:
Pardon, master;
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
Part, fools!
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
Partly for that her promised proportions
Pass no further.
Pass'd over to the end they were created,
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
Past the mid season.
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
Pattern in himself to know,
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
Peace be with you!
Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
Peace!
Peace!
Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Peace, Tranio!
Peace, both, and hear me speak.
Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
Peace, foolish woman.
Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Peace, peace!
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Peace, peace; be not so loud.
Peace, sirrah!
Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
Peace, you mumbling fool!

Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who

Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
Petruchio, stand by a while.
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,

Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,

Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven

Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.

Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,

Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Put them not to't:
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
Put up your swords.
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,

Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Rage must be withstood:
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
Ratcliff!
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
Rather our state's defective for requital
Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
Rather than envy you.
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
Read it not, noble lords;
Read it.
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
Read the indictment.
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.
Ready to go, but never to return.
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
Real necessities, and give way the while
Reason; because they then less need one another.
Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Reignier, her father, to the king of France
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
Relent, and save your souls.
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
Remember since you owed no more to time
Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
Remembering how I love thy company.
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
Repair to the Capitol.
Repair to the senate-house.
Repair'd with double riches of content.
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
Repent in their election.
Repent what you have spoke.
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
Repented o'er his doom.
Report of fashions in proud Italy,
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
Requite your love!
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
Resides not in that man that does not think,--
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
Resolved. resolved.
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
Rest you merry!
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Retire to win our purpose.
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
Return again, and take an oath with thee.
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Return to the tribunes.
Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
Return with welcome home from banishment.
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
Reveal yourself to him.
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
Reward did threaten and encourage him,
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
Richard!
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,
Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
Richly in both, if justice had her right.
Richmond is on the seas.
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.
Right son to the right Vincentio;
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
Right,
Right, I mean you.
Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
Right.
Right.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Rise up, good aunt.

Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
Romeo can,
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
Romeo is coming.
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
Romeo will answer it.
Romeo!
Romeo!
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
Romeo, away, be gone!
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
Romeo.
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
Roundly replied.
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.
Royal commanders, be in readiness:
Royally!
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
Rumour it abroad
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

SURREY:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
Saddle my horse.
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
Safely in harbour
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Salisbury?
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
Satisfy!
Save back to England, all the world's my way.
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
Save for the son that she did litter here,
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
Save men's opinions and my living blood,
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
Save you, sir.
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Saw you Aufidius?
Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
Say as he says, or we shall never go.
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
Say it be, 'tis true.
Say no more:
Say no more:
Say not we brought it.
Say on, my loving lord.
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
Say so but seldom.
Say that I did all this for love of her.
Say that I slew them not?
Say that again.
Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
Say there be;
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Say you the like to him?
Say you?
Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
Say, I command her to come to me.
Say, I will love her everlastingly.
Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?
Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?
Say, by this token, I desire his company
Say, has our general met the enemy?
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
Say, then, my peace is made.
Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
Say, what's thy name?
Say, you chose him
Say, you ne'er had done't--
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Scars to move laughter only.
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
Scratches with briers,
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
Scrivener:
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
See here these movers that do prize their hours
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
See how he fares.
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
See how the morning opes her golden gates,
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
See that Claudio
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
See what I do deliver out to each,
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
See you the fornicatress be removed:
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
See, see; what a man you are now!
See, they have shut him in.
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
See, where he stands between two clergymen!
See, your guests approach:
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
Seeking a way and straying from the way;
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
Seize him, AEdiles!
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Self against self: O, preposterous
Self-loving,--
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.
Sent by the king your father
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.

Served well for Rome,--
Servile to all the skyey influences,
Set down by the poll?
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
Set down, set down your honourable load,
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
Seven year and a half, sir.
Seventh Citizen:
Shake it off. Come on;
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
Shall I attend your lordship?
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Shall I be heard?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
Shall I be your playfellow?
Shall I bring thee on the way?
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
Shall I forget myself to be myself?
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
Shall I obtain it?
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
Shall I send to thee?
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
Shall be the label to another deed,
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
Shall bring Emilia forth.
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
Shall darken him for ever.
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
Shall have a high reward, and he his life?
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Shall have the chinks.
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.
Shall remain!
Shall rest in London till we come to him.
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
Shall satisfy your father.
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
Shall she within my power.
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Shall the contents discover, something rare
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
Shall win the wager which we will propose.
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
Shalt with him hence.
Sham it be put to that?
Shame come to Romeo!
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
She came adorned hither like sweet May,
She came from Libya.
She comes to do you good.
She could have run and waddled all about;
She dances featly.
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
She embraces him.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
She had just cause.
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
She had; and would incense me
She hangs about his neck:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She is as forward of her breeding as
She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
She is i' the rear our birth.
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
She is something before her time deliver'd.
She is spread of late
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
She is,
She it is.
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may help you to many fair preferments,
She may more suitors have and me for one.
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
She may, my lord, for--
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
She prizes not such trifles as these are:
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She says your worship means to make
She shall be habited as it becomes
She shall be married to this noble earl.
She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
She shall not.
She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
She shall, she shall.
She should not visit you.
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
She speaks:
She that accuses him of fornication,
She the adulteress; for the harlot king
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
She was the fairest creature in the world;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
She will indite him to some supper.
She will not come: she bids you come to her.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
She will not.
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
She would to each one sip. You are retired,
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
She's an adulteress.
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
She's not fourteen.
She's not well married that lives married long;
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
She's very near her hour.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
Shed for my thankless country are requited
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!

Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
Should I now meet my father,
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
Should a like language use to all degrees
Should a villain say so,
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
Should be 'Remember mine.'
Should be as holy as severe;
Should be in them to give.
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Should be! should--buzz!
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
Should die for ever.
Should dying men flatter with those that live?
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
Should know we were afoot.
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
Should not be able to encounter mine.
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
Should not become my wife and England's queen.
Should not produce fair issue.
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
Should now eat up her own!
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Should they not,
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
Should well agree with our external parts?
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Shouting their emulation.
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
Show duty, as mistaken all this while
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
Show me how, good father.
Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Signior Baptista may remember me,
Signior Baptista's liberality,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
Silence! one word more
Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
Since I am charged in honour and by him
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
Since I am put to know that your own science
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
Since every Jack became a gentleman
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
Since thou, created to be awed by man,
Since we can not atone you, we shall see
Since what I am to say must be but that
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
Sir,
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
Sir, I cannot tell:
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
Sir, I hope
Sir, I know him, and I love him.
Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
Sir, I think
Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
Sir, I will tell you;
Sir, a word ere you go;
Sir, are not you my father?
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
Sir, believe this,
Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
Sir, have pity;
Sir, he may live:
Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
Sir, his stoutness
Sir, how comes't that you
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
Sir, in Argier.
Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
Sir, it is a mystery.
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
Sir, it is;
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Sir, make me not your story.
Sir, most heedfully.
Sir, my gracious lord,
Sir, my liege,
Sir, my lord,
Sir, my mistress sends you word
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
Sir, praise me not;
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
Sir, sir,--
Sir, spare your threats:
Sir, that's to-morrow.
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
Sir, the people
Sir, the year growing ancient,
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
Sir, those cold ways,
Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
Sir, we have all
Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
Sir,--
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.
Sirrah, no more!
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
Sirrah, where have you been?
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
Sirs, take up the corse.
Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Sits safe and still without him.
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
Six frozen winter spent,
Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
Sixth Citizen:
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Slain, sir, doubtless.
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
Slandering a prince deserves it.
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
Small joy have I in being England's queen.
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!
Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
So God help Montague as he proves true!
So I am, to let him live.
So I by that; it is my day, my life.
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
So I to her and so she yields to me;
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
So York may overlook the town of York.
So aged as this seems.
So and no other, as yourself commanded:
So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
So can I name his faults,--
So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
So criminal and in such capital kind,
So cunning and so young is wonderful.
So deal with him as I prove true to you.
So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
So did we all. But, come, let's home.
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
So dissolute a crew.
So do I ever:
So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
So doth the cony struggle in the net.
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
So early walking did I see your son:
So easily open?
So every scope by the immoderate use
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
So far from sounding and discovery,
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fearful were they of infection.
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
So fled his enemies my warlike father:
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
So full of dismal terror was the time!
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
So had you need.
So happy is your brother.
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
So he did, my lord:
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
So high above his limits swells the rage
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
So incapable of help.
So is it in the music of men's lives.
So is the dear'st o' the loss.
So is the equal of this fell war.
So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
So it is.
So it must fall out
So it should seem by that I have to say.
So just is God, to right the innocent.
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
So long could I
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
So longest way shall have the longest moans.
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
So many blows upon this face of mine,
So many days my ewes have been with young;
So many greedy looks of young and old
So many guests invite as here are writ.
So many hours must I contemplate;
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many hours must I take my rest;
So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
So many miseries have crazed my voice,
So many summers dry; scarce any joy
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
So may you lose your arms:
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
So mighty and so many my defects,
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
So much as of a thought of ill in him.
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
So much the more our carver's excellence;
So much to my good comfort, as it is
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
So other foes may set upon our backs.
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
So part we sadly in this troublous world,
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
So please you, let me now be left alone,
So please you, madam,
So please you, sir, their speed
So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
So please your lordship to accept our duty.
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
So said, so done, is well.
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
So season'd with your faithful love to me.
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
So she does any thing; though I report it,
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
So should we you, if you should be our king.
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
So singular in each particular,
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
So sovereignly being honourable.
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
So stands this squire
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
So stumblest on my counsel?
So sure as this beard's grey,
So sweet is zealous contemplation.
So that all hope is vain.
So that by this intelligence we learn
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
So then it seems your most offenceful act
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
So they are;
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
So thrive my soul--
So to enforce or qualify the laws
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.
So two, together weeping, make one woe.
So vulgarly and personally accused,
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
So well I know my duty to my elders.
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
So wildly?
So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
So will it, madam till I lie with you.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
So would you be again to Henry,
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
So, here comes a brace.
So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
So, now prosperity begins to mellow
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
So, slave; hence!
So, so: farewell; we are gone.
So, the good horse is mine.
So, to our tent;
So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
So.
So.
So. What trade are you of, sir?
Soft son!
Soft! I will go along;
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
Soft! who comes here?
Soft, sir! one word more.
Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.
Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
Soldier:
Soldiers, away with him!
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
Some comet or unusual prodigy?
Some comfort, nurse.
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
Some dungeon.
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
Some misadventure.
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
Some one be ready with a costly suit
Some one take order Buckingham be brought
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
Some remedies for life.
Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!
Something unfilial: reason my son
Sometime in Greece,--
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.
Son:
Son:
Son:
Son:
Sons, peace!
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
Sorrow and grief of heart
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
Sound, sound, sound, sound!
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
South from the mighty power of the king.
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Spare not for the cost.
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
Speak briefly then;
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Speak ere thou diest.
Speak freely what you think.
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'
Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.
Speak that,--
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
Speak, good Cominius:
Speak, good Sicinius.
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
Speak, speak.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
Spies of the Volsces
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Splitting the air with noise.
Spoke he of me?
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!
Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.
Spread further.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
Spur post, and get before him to the king,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
Stand all apart,
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
Stand by, a looker on.
Stand fast;
Stand in their ancient strength.
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
Stand more for number than for accompt.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Stand you auspicious!
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?
Stand, and go back.
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
Standing like stone with thee.
Standing your friendly lord.
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?
Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
Stars, stars,
Start not; her actions shall be holy as
Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
Stay a little while.
Stay and be secret, and myself will go.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
Stay your thanks a while;
Stay, Edward.
Stay, fellow; I can read.
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
Stay, or thou diest!
Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.
Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
Stay: whence are you?
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.
Stays here longer.
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
Step forth mine advocate; at your request
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Still live they and for ever may they last!
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
Still thus, and thus; still worse!
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
Stop there, stop there.
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Stop,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
Strike the drum.
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
Strike, drum.
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Subdues me quite. Even till now,
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
Successively from age to age, he built it?
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
Such a mad marriage never was before:
Such a nature,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
Such goodly things as you!
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
Such is the lightness of you common men.
Such it seems
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
Such terrible impression made the dream.
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
Summon a session, that we may arraign
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
Suppose the singing birds musicians,
Suppose they take offence without a cause,
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Supposing it a thing impossible,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
Surrey, thou liest.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
Swarming with caterpillars?
Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
Swear his thought over
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
Swear, if thou darest.
Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
Sweet madam.
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
Sweet sister, let me live:
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
Sweet, so would I:
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,

Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
Take all myself.
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
Take hands, a bargain!
Take heed you dally not before your king;
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.
Take her hence:
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
Take him up gently and to bed with him;
Take honour from me, and my life is done:
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
Take my prayers with you.
Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.
Take that, until thou bring me better news.
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
Take thy commission.
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
Take up the sword again, or take up me.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Takes on the point of honour to support
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
Talkers are no good doers: be assured
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.
Teach her the way.
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
Tell her, Emilia.
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
Tell him, when that our princely father York
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Tell me of corn!
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
Tell me thine first.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
Tell not me:
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
Tell them, when that my mother went with child
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
Temperance was a delicate wench.
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
Temptations have since then been born to's; for
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
Than I of yours;
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
Than a delightful measure or a dance;
Than a great queen, with this condition,
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
Than any woman in this waning age.
Than are upon you yet.
Than at the strangeness of it.
Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
Than bees that made 'em.
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Than by self-offences weighing.
Than camels in the war, who have their provand
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
Than can my ears that tragic history.
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Than die for this.
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
Than hear say how I got them.
Than history can pattern, though devised
Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
Than in Lord Angelo.
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Than is the doting title of a mother;
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
Than misery itself would give; rewards
Than most have of his age.
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
Than my poor life must answer.
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
Than other princesses can that have more time
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Than so much loss of time.
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
Than sway with them in theirs.
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Than that of common sons.
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
Than the rebuke you give it.
Than the severity of the public power
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
Than thou hast spoken words?
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
Than to perform it first.
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
Than violentest contrariety.
Than was that young and princely gentleman.
Than we bring men to comfort them:
Than we to stretch it out.
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Than what you look on now.
Than what you should, made you against the grain
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.
Than when it was a-doing.
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
Than you can put us to't.
Than you to punish.
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
Than your good words. But who comes here?
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
Thank you, sir: farewell.
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
Thanks, dear Isabel.
Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
Thanks, noble peer;
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
That
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
That Edward is escaped from your brother,
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
That England, that was wont to conquer others,
That God had lent us but this only child;
That God, the law, my honour and her love,
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
That I am proud to hunt.
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
That I desire to hear her speak again,
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
That I have borne your father?
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
That I have had of thee!
That I have worn a visor and could tell
That I have worn so many winters out,
That I in all despite might rail at him,
That I may call thee something more than man
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
That I may never have you in suspect.
That I may pass this doing.
That I may see my shadow as I pass.
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.
That I might touch that cheek!
That I must bear a part.
That I must love a loathed enemy.
That I must yield my body to the earth
That I myself have done unto myself?
That I revived, and was an emperor.
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
That I should do what I abhor to name,
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That I should yet absent me from your bed:
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
That I was not ignoble of descent;
That I was nothing.
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
That I will show you shining at this feast,
That I would have spoke of:
That I yet know not?
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
That I'll try.
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
That Marcius shall be consul:
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
That Rome can make against them.
That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
That Romeo bid thee fetch?
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
That all is done in reverend care of her;
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
That all the world will be in love with night
That all your acts are queens.
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
That always favour'd him.
That any did. Had we pursued that life,
That any harm should stain so fair a show!
That any of these bolder vices wanted
That apprehends no further than this world,
That art to me as secret and as dear
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
That at the parting all the church did echo:
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
That best can aid your action.
That bids me be of comfort any more.
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
That blood already, like the pelican,
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That both our powers, with smiling
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
That brings me food to make misfortune live?
That brought thee to this world.
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
That bucket down and full of tears am I,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
That by degrees we mean to look into,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
That came too lag to see him buried.
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
That can less hide his love or hate than he;
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
That carries no impression like the dam.
That changeth thus his manners.
That come before the swallow dares, and take
That common chances common men could bear;
That copest with death himself to scape from it:
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
That covenants may be kept on either hand.
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
That doth utter all men's ware-a.
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
That dreamers often lie.
That e'er I put between your holy looks
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
That e'er the sun shone bright on.
That e'er was heard or read!
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
That ever graced me in thy company?
That ever lived.
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
That ever was survey'd by English eye,
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
That every day under his household roof
That every stride he makes upon my land
That everything I look on seemeth green:
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That face of his the hungry cannibals
That faced and braved me in this matter so?
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
That go before it.
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
That hath authority over him that swears:
That hath beside well in his person wrought
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That have beheld me give away myself
That have beheld the doing.
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
That he did stay?
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
That he should hither come as this dire night,
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
That he was never trained up in arms.
That he will give them make I as little question
That he will not be won to aught against him.
That he would labour my delivery.
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
That his soul sicken not.
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
That hour destroy us?
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That idles in the wanton summer air,
That if about this hour he make his way
That if our queen and this young prince agree,
That in a Christian climate souls refined
That in a twink she won me to her love.
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
That in himself which he spurs on his power
That in his nonage council under him,
That in submission will return to us:
That in the captain's but a choleric word,
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
That in these several places of the city
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
That is my office, for my father's sake.
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
That is the way to lay the city flat;
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
That is, her love; for that is all in all.
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That is, were I under the terms of death,
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
That it becomes a virtue.
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
That it may show me what a face I have,
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
That it shall hold companionship in peace
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
That it would please thee leave these sad designs
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That knew'st this was the prince,
That know not how to use ambassadors,
That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
That laid the sentence of dread banishment
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
That life is better life, past fearing death,
That lift your vassal hands against my head
That like a father you will deal with him
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
That look into me with considerate eyes:
That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
That looks not heavily and full of fear.
That love should of a sudden take such hold?
That love the fundamental part of state
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
That make her good? O, let her brother live!
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
That makes these odds all even.
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
That many have and others must sit there;
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
That modesty may more betray our sense
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
That most are busied when they're most alone,
That most are willing. If any such be here--
That mought not be distinguished; but at last
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
That my ability may undergo
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
That my revengeful services may prove
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
That never mean to part.
That no dissension hinder government:
That no man enter till my tale be done.
That no man shall have private conference,
That no particular scandal once can touch
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
That none of you may live your natural age,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
That of all things upon the earth he hated
That offer service to your lordship.
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.
That only like a gulf it did remain
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
That owes two buckets, filling one another,
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
That power I have, discharge; and let them go
That presses him from sleep.
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
That prosperously I have attempted and
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
That reacheth from the restful English court
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
That same villain, Romeo.
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
That seeth not this palpable device?
That set'st the word itself against the word!
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.
That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
That shall remain a poison where it is,
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
That shall you know hereafter.
That shapes man better; and they follow him,
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
That she is busy and she cannot come.
That she is living,
That she may long live here, God say amen!
That she shall have; besides an argosy
That she shall still be curst in company.
That she was coming with a full intent
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
That should be silent: if young Doricles
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
That should by private order else have died,
That should consume it, I have not the face
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
That so I may, by this device, at least
That sort was well fished for.
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
That starts i' the way before thee.
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
That take it on you at the first so roundly.
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
That taught his son the office of a fowl!
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
That tell black tidings.
That tempers him to this extremity.
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
That the precipitation might down stretch
That their events can never fall out good.
That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
That they combine not there.
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
That they have let the dangerous enemy
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
That they who brought me in my master's hate
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
That this his love was an eternal plant,
That this is true, father, behold his blood.
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
That this same very day your enemies,
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
That thou commend it strangely to some place
That thou consent to marry us to-day.
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
That thought he could do more, a very little
That thought them sure of you.
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
That till the father rid his hands of her,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
That to my foes this body must be prey,
That to the observer doth thy history
That took away the match from Isabel,
That trembles under his devouring paws;
That triumph thus upon my misery!
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
That turns their countenances.
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
That waits upon your grace?
That want no ear but yours.
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
That we are those which chased you from the field
That we could hear no news of his repair?
That we have bled together. Coriolanus
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
That we may arm us to encounter it.
That we may be admitted where he is.
That we may bring you something on the way.
That we may call it early by and by.
That we may praise thee in the victory!
That we remember. There is our commission,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
That we were all, as some would seem to be,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
That were some love but little policy.
That were some spite: my invocation
That were the cause of my imprisonment.
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
That which I shall report will bear no credit,
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
That which in mean men we intitle patience
That which my daughter came to look upon,
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
That while Verona by that name is known,
That will I make before I let thee go.
That will I.
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
That will be never: tune your instrument.
That will encounter with our glorious sun,
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
That will say anything but were they false
That will the king severely prosecute
That wilt not stay her tongue.
That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
That with such vehemency he should pursue
That with the king here resteth in his tent?
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
That without desert have frown'd on me;
That won you without blows! Despising,
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
That would I learn of you,
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
That would depopulate the city and
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
That would reduce these bloody days again,
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
That wrings mine eyes to't.
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
That you depart and lay no hands on me
That you do speak to the people.
That you have slander'd so?
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
That you may know you shall not want, one word.
That you might know it, would much better please me
That you might still have worn the petticoat,
That you might well enjoy her.
That you might well have signified the same
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
That you shall stifle in your own report
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?
That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.
That your estate requires and mine can yield.
That your free undertaking cannot miss
That's I, an't like your grace:
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
That's a certain text.
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
That's bitter to sweet end.
That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
That's enough.
That's he indeed.
That's lesser than a little.
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
That's my brave boy!
That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
That's my noble master!
That's my office.
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
That's off, that's off;
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
That's somewhat madly spoken.
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
That's true enough;
That's worthily
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
That's your device.
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
That, being a stranger in this city here,
That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
That, by confessing them, the souls of men
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
That, in the official marks invested, you
That, in the working of your own affections,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
That, were my state far worser than it is,
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
The Emperor of Russia was my father:
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
The King of Naples, being an enemy
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
The Tower, the Tower.
The Volsces are in arms.
The Volsces dare break with us.
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
The access of gentle visitors!
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
The addition nobly ever!
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
The adventure of her person?
The aediles, ho!
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
The anger of the king nor guilty of,
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
The appellant in all duty greets your highness,
The apprehension of his present portance,
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
The army of the queen hath got the field:
The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
The art itself is nature.
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
The badges of his grief and patience,
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
The benefit of our levies, answering us
The benefit thereof is always granted
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
The best, with whom we may articulate,
The better for him: would I were so too!
The better that your lordship please to ask.
The better, given me by so holy a man.
The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
The blessed gods
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
The blood I drop is rather physical
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
The blood of English shall manure the ground,
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
The bloody office of his timeless end.
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
The book of his good acts, whence men have read
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
The bound of honour, or in act or will
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
The breath of garlic-eaters!
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
The cares I give I have, though given away;
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
The causes of their death appear, unto
The centre is not big enough to bear
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
The charges of the action. We have made peace
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
The children live, whose parents thou hast
The chopping French we do not understand.
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
The citizens of Corioli have issued,
The city is well stored.
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
The cockerel.
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
The common muck of the world: he covets less
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
The common people swarm like summer flies;
The common praise it bears.
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
The commons will not then be satisfied.
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
The consul Coriolanus.
The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
The county will be here with music straight,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The crown of England, father, which is yours.
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
The crows to peck the eagles.
The cruelty and envy of the people,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
The curse my noble father laid on thee,
The custom of request you have discharged:
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
The damned'st body to invest and cover
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
The date is out of such prolixity:
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
The day is broke; be wary, look about.
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
The deed you undertake is damnable.
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
The deputy elected by the Lord:
The deserts of Bohemia?
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
The duke is made protector of the realm;
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
The emptier ever dancing in the air,
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
The evil that thou causest to be done,
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
The execution of my big-swoln heart
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
The fatal colours of our striving houses:
The father of this seeming lady and
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
The father, all whose joy is nothing else
The fault's your own.
The faults of fools but folly.
The favours of these men: were they not mine?
The fear of that withholds my present aid.
The fee-simple! O simple!
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
The first conditions, which they did refuse
The first departing of the king for Ireland.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
The former agents, if they did complain,
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
The fraughting souls within her.
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The gates are open, let us enter too.
The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
The general is my lover: I have been
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
The generous and gravest citizens
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
The glistering of this present, as my tale
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
The god of soldiers,
The gods assist you!
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
The gods be good unto us!
The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
The gods forbid!
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
The gods grant them true!
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.
The gods preserve you both!
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
The good old man would fain that all were well,
The government I cast upon my brother
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The greatest strength and power he can make,
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
The ground indeed is tawny.
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
The happy tidings of his good escape.
The harder match'd, the greater victory:
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
The hateful commons will perform for us,
The hateful mansion.
The hazard of much blood.
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:
The heads of the maids?
The heart that conn'd them.
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
The heavens give safety to your purposes!
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
The higher powers forbid!
The history of all her secret thoughts:
The honour of my child.
The honourable father to my foe
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
The horrible conceit of death and night,
The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
The hour's now come;
The household of the king.
The image of it gives me content already; and I
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
The instruments that feel.
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
The keeper of the prison, call to him;
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
The king by this is set him down to sleep.
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
The king hath on him such a countenance
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
The king is not himself, but basely led
The king my father wreck'd.
The king my uncle is to blame for this:
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.
The king shall be contented: must he lose
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
The king! why, who's that?
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.
The king's son have I landed by himself;
The king's will be perform'd!
The king, of his own royal disposition,
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
The lady stirs.
The lamb will never cease to follow him.
The lamb.
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
The language I have learn'd these forty years,
The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.
The late demand that you did sound me in.
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
The law against it! But that her tender shame
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
The leading of thine own revenges, take
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
The letter was not nice but full of charge
The life of Tybalt.
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
The lineal glory of your royal house,
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
The lord protector lost it, and not I:
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
The loss you have is but a son being king,
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
The love of wicked men converts to fear;
The lustful Edward's title buried--
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
The man I am.
The man I speak of cannot in the world
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
The manage of my state; as at that time
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
The manner of their taking may appear
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
The match is made, and all is done:
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
The matter?
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
The meat was well, if you were so contented.
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
The mighty dukes
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
The miserable have no other medicine
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
The more I have, for both are infinite.
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
The more that Henry was unfortunate.
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
The most arch of piteous massacre
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
The most replenished sweet work of nature,
The most you sought was her promotion;
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
The motion's good indeed and be it so,
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
The napless vesture of humility;
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
The news I have to tell your majesty
The news is very fair and good, my lord:
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
The news, Rogero?
The next degree is England's royal throne;
The next news is, I have to London sent
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
The noble duke hath been too much abused.
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
The noble knot he made.
The noble man have mercy.
The noble sister of Publicola,
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
The nobles in great earnestness are going
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
The odds for high and low's alike.
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
The old cock.
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
The one by the other.
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
The one half of my commission; and set down--
The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
The one his purple blood right well resembles;
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
The one side must have bale.
The only son of your great enemy.
The open ear of youth doth always listen;
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
The other did not so.
The other down, unseen and full of water:
The other for some while a friend.
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
The other part reserved I by consent,
The other to enjoy by rage and war:
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
The pale moon shines by night:
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
The patron of my life and liberty.
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
The people are abused; set on. This paltering
The people are incensed against him.
The people are the city.
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
The people in the street cry Romeo,
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
The people will remain uncertain whilst
The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
The people's magistrates.
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
The phrase is to the matter.
The pine and let thee out.
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
The precedent was full as long a-doing:
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
The precious jewel of thy home return.
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
The prenzie Angelo!
The present benefit which I possess;
The present consul, and last general
The present wars devour him: he is grown
The presentation of but what I was;
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
The price is to ask it kindly.
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
The princes both make high account of you;
The proffer'd means of succor and redress.
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
The purest treasure mortal times afford
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
The purity of his.
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
The purple testament of bleeding war;
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
The queen hath best success when you are absent.
The queen is coming with a puissant host;
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
The queen of Naples.
The queen of curds and cream.
The queen this day here holds her parliament,
The queen with all the northern earls and lords
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
The queen your mother, and your brother York,
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
The rarest of all women.
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
The rather for I have some sport in hand
The rather for I now must make you know
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
The readiest way to make the wench amends
The red rose and the white are on his face,
The resignation of thy state and crown
The rest o' the island.
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
The royal fool thou copest with,--
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
The ruin of the state.
The running of one glass.
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
The same, sir.
The sands are number'd that make up my life;
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
The second and the third, nine, and some five;
The second name of men, obeys his points
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
The senators and patricians love him too:
The senators of Rome are this good belly,
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
The service of the foot
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
The setting sun, and music at the close,
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
The shadow or your face.
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
The sight of any of the house of York
The silence often of pure innocence
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
The slavish motive of recanting fear,
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The smallest scruple of her excellence
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
The son, the husband and the father tearing
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
The spacious world cannot again afford
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
The standing of his body.
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
The state and inclination of the day:
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.
The statue of her mother.
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
The sternness of his presence?
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
The strangeness of your story put
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
The sun will not be seen to-day;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
The swelling difference of your settled hate:
The swifter speed the better.
The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
The tears have got small victory by that;
The tediousness and process of my travel:
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
The testimony on my part no other
The theme of our assembly.
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
The thought of my revenges that way
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
The thwartings of your dispositions, if
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
The time hath been,
The time is worth the use on't.
The time shall not be many hours of age
The time to come.
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
The times that brought them in; so shall I do
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
The town is ta'en!
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
The treason that my haste forbids me show.
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The true succeeders of each royal house,
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
The unity the king thy brother made
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
The vantage of his anger.
The vaporous night approaches.
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
The verier wag o' the two?
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
The very beams will dry those vapours up,
The very life seems warm upon her lip.
The very mercy of the law cries out
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
The very trick on't.
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
The very way to catch them.
The violation of my faith; and then
The violent carriage of it
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
The visitor will not give him o'er so.
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
The want thereof makes thee abominable:
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
The warlike service he has done, consider; think
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
The washing of ten tides!
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
The way twice o'er.
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
The weary sun hath made a golden set,
The weary way hath made you melancholy.
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
The what?
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
The which shall turn you to no further harm
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
The which will I; not all so much for love
The which you promised I should possess.
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
The wild waves whist,
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
The worst is death, and death will have his day.
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
The worthiest men have done't?
The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
The young'st and oldest thing.
The younger then is free and not before.
The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Their banners wave again.
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Their liberties; make them of no more voice
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
Their perch and not their terror.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
Their very heart of hope.
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
Then 'tis but reason that I be released
Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
Then I degraded you from being king,
Then I must not say no.
Then I salute you with this kingly title:
Then I will give you the serving-creature.
Then I'll commend her volubility,
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
Then am I king'd again: and by and by
Then at my lodging, an it like you:
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
Then be it so; and go we to determine
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
Then call them to our presence; face to face,
Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
Then give me leave to go.
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
Then go with me to make the matter good.
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
Then his good report should have been my son; I
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
Then is he more beholding to you than I.
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
Then is my sovereign slain?
Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Then know, it is your fault that you resign
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
Then let my father's blood open it again:
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
Then list to me:
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
Then music with her silver sound'--
Then must your brother die.
Then my account I well may, give,
Then never man was true.
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
Then our office may,
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
Then patiently hear my impatience.
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Then show it me.
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
Then thou dwellest with daws too?
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
Then we are rid of Licio.
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
Then whither goest? say, whither?
Then whither he goes, thither let me go.
Then why should they love Edward more than me?
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
Then, England's messenger, return in post,
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
Then, as the manner of our country is,
Then, by myself--
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
Then, worthy Marcius,
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
There have I made my promise
There have been,
There he must stay until the officer
There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
There is a sickness
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
There is a vice that most I do abhor,
There is a world elsewhere.
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
There is an art which in their piedness shares
There is another comfort than this world,
There is another friar that set them on;
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
There is no more but so: say it is done,
There is no other way
There is no other way but to tell the king
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
There is no virtue like necessity.
There is no world without Verona walls,
There is no wrong, but every thing is right.
There is none worthy,
There is some sap in this.
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
There is, there is.
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
There lie, and there thy character: there these;
There lies that Tybalt.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
There rest.
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
There shall be order for't.
There shall no figure at such rate be set
There shall not at your father's house these
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
There to be crowned England's royal king:
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
There was a friar told me of this man.
There was a man--
There was a time when all the body's members
There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
There was it:
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.
There's magic in thy majesty, which has
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
There's many have committed it.
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
There's no harm done.
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
There's no remedy;
There's no trust,
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
There's some conceit or other likes him well,
There's some ill planet reigns:
There's some in hope.
There's thy reward: be gone.
There's time enough for that;
There, Coriolanus.
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
There.
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
Therefore I came unto your majesty.
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
Therefore I will not disdain.
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
Therefore lay hold of him;
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
Therefore, at your vantage,
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
Therefore, my lord,--
Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.
Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
Therefore, we banish you our territories:
Therefore--
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
These English woes will make me smile in France.
These accusations and these grievous crimes
These and these conveyances of our blood
These are a side that would be glad to have
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
These both put by a poor petitioner,
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
These dead men's tombs.
These differences shall all rest under gage
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
These letters at fit time deliver me
These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
These news I must confess are full of grief;
These poor informal women are no more
These rural latches to his entrance open,
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
These three lead on this preparation
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
These violent delights have violent ends
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
These were his very words.
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
These your unusual weeds to each part of you
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
They are already, or quickly will be landed:
They are as children but one step below,
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They are free men, but I am banished.
They are inclined to do so.
They are near the city?
They are not such as you.
They are worn, lord consul, so,
They are.
They are; and Bolingbroke
They break their faith to God as well as us:
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
They could not speak; and so I left them both,
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
They have a leader,
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
They have chose a consul that will from them take
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
They have placed their men of trust?
They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
They love not poison that do poison need,
They may break his foaming courser's back,
They might have lived to bear and he to taste
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
They must take it in sense that feel it.
They needs must show themselves; which
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
They often feel a world of restless cares:
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
They prosper best of all when I am thence.
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
They say she's mad.
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
They set the same; and there it doth remain,
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
They shall not live within this world, I swear,
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
They thus directed, we will follow
They took his head, and on the gates of York
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
They will, then, ere't be long.
They would not take her life. Is not this true?
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
They'll give him death by inches.
They'll open of themselves.
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
They've not prepared for us.
They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
Thieves for their robbery have authority
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
Things past redress are now with me past care.
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
Think not the king did banish thee,
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Think upon me! hang 'em!
Think what you will, we seize into our hands
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
Think you so, sir?
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
Think you, but that I know our state secure,
Think you, my lord, this little prating York
Think'st thou I am an executioner?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
Thinking upon his services, took from you

Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
This a consul? no.
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
This and much more, much more than twice all this,
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
This battle fares like to the morning's war,
This being granted in course,--and now follows
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
This but begins the woe, others must end.
This but done,
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
This cannot be but a great courtier.
This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
This day had plotted, in the council-house
This day my sister should the cloister enter
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
This day those enemies are put to death,
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This dead king to the living king I'll bear
This deadly blot in thy digressing son.
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
This deserves death.
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
This done, he took the bride about the neck
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
This favour will I do you for his sake;
This feast of battle with mine adversary.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
This follows, if you will not change your purpose
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
This fortress built by Nature for herself
This found I on my tent this morning.
This gentleman is happily arrived,
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
This hand should chop it off, and with the
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This interchange of love, I here protest,
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
This is a brave fellow.
This is a gentle provost: seldom when
This is a happier and more comely time
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
This is a poor epitome of yours,
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
This is all:
This is another prisoner that I saved.
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
This is clean kam.
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
This is desperate, sir.
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
This is good news:
This is his lordship's man.
This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
This is it that makes me bridle passion
This is most likely!
This is most likely!
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
This is she--
This is strange now: do you two know how you are
This is strange.
This is strange: methinks
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
This is the palace of the fearful king,
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
This is the point.
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
This is thy sheath;
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
This is true that I say: an I had thee
This is unlikely:
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
This isle with Calibans.
This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
This last old man,
This let alone will all the rest confound.
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
This letter he early bid me give his father,
This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
This liberty is all that I request,
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
This man has marr'd his fortune.
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
This may prove worse than hanging.
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
This music crept by me upon the waters,
This music mads me; let it sound no more;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
This news is mortal to the queen: look down
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
This oath I willingly take and will perform.
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This other doth command a little door
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
This prison where I live unto the world:
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
This sensible warm motion to become
This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
This shall assure my constant loyalty,
This shall be done, good father, presently.
This shall determine that.
This shows a sound affection.
This sickly land might solace as before.
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
This virtue and this moral discipline,
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
This way the king will come; this is the way
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
This we prescribe, though no physician;
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
This will I carry to Rome.
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
This will last out a night in Russia,
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
This your request
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
This, as you say, suggested
This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
This, here before you.
This, my lord.
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
Thither will I with you; for little office
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?
Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Those are they
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
Those men you talk of came into my mind.
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Those whose great power must try him; even this,
Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
Thou art as opposite to every good
Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
Thou art my warrior;
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
Thou call'dst me king.
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
Thou camest here to complain.
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
Thou camest--
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
Thou dearest Perdita,
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
Thou didst speak but well
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
Thou dost advise me
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
Thou dost make possible things not so held,
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Thou earth, thou! speak.
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
Thou fond mad woman,
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
Thou hast faced many things.
Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
Thou hast not done before.
Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
Thou hast said enough.
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Thou hast sworn my love to be.
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Thou mightst be freed.
Thou most lying slave,
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
Thou must be married to no man but me;
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Thou shalt be free
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
Thou shalt not do't.
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
Thou speak'st truth.
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Thou talk'st of nothing.
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Thou to me thy secrets tell.
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
Thou wilt amend thy life?
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Thou wilt perform my bidding.
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.
Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Though I could wish
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
Though angel on the outward side!
Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.
Though bearing misery, I desire my life
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Though every drop of water swear against it
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
Though not for Rome itself.
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
Though thanks to all, must I select
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
Though there the people had more absolute power,
Though therein you can never be too noble,
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
Though this island seem to be desert,--
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
Though thou speak'st truth,
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
Though you are old enough to be my heir.
Though you perceive me not how I give line.
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
Though you would seek to unsphere the
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
Thoughts that would thick my blood.
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
Three, my most gracious lord.
Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
Through all the signories it was the first
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Through it do well, I do not relish well
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
Thus I conceive by him.
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Thus can the demigod Authority
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
Thus high at least, although your knee be low.
Thus high, by thy advice
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
Thus plated in habiliments of war,
Thus play I in one person many people,
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
Thus to have said,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.
Thus will I drown your exclamations.
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
Thy exercise hath been too violent for
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Thy father hath.
Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Thy father's ground.
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Thy friend no less
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
Thy life answer!
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
Thy lips are warm.
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
Thy news?
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
Thy word is current with him for my death,
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Thyself thyself misusest.
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
Till I have told this slander of his blood,
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
Till he be dieted to my request,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
Till one can do no more.
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
Till she herself confess it.
Till storms be past of civil enmity.
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
Till the prince came, who parted either part.
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
Till we assign you to your days of trial.
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
Till you have done your business in the city:
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
Time:
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
To Bolingbroke.
To Bona, sister to the King of France.
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
To Bristol castle, which they say is held
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
To County Paris, to prepare him up
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
To Edward, but not to the English king.
To England's king in lawful marriage.
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
To God, my king and my succeeding issue,
To God, the widow's champion and defence.
To Henry Bolingbroke.
To Henry's body, and supply his place;
To Italy; and there at Venice gave
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
To Lammas-tide?
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
To Lynn, my lord,
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
To a determined scope.
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
To ally my rages and revenges with
To alter this, for counsel is but vain.
To an impatient child that hath new robes
To an infected jelly and my name
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
To answer all the city.
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
To answer that, I should confess to you.
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
To answer twenty thousand such as you.
To answer us.
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
To avoid the carping censures of the world.
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
To banish your defenders; till at length
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
To base declension and loathed bigamy
To bate me a full year.
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
To be a make-peace shall become my age:
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
To be consorted with the humorous night:
To be discover'd, that can do me good?
To be full like me: yet they say we are
To be full quit of those my banishers,
To be her men and wear her livery:
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
To be inclined my way!
To be no better than a homely swain;
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
To be or none or little; though a devil
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
To be revenged on him that loveth you.
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
To be set high in place, we did commend
To be so bouted in this royal presence?
To be so rid o' the business.
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
To be the father unto many sons.
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
To be your comforter when he is gone.
To be your prisoner should import offending;
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
To bear his image and renew his glories!
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
To bear the tidings of calamity.
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
To bend the fatal instruments of war
To better purpose.
To better vantage.
To bid me trudge:
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
To bless the bed of majesty again
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
To blot out me, and put his own son in.
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
To break the heart of generosity,
To breakfast once forth of my company.
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
To bring the roof to the foundation,
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
To bury mine intents, but also to effect
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
To buy you a better husband.
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To call upon him.
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
To cleave a heart in twain.
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
To come at first when he doth send for her,
To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
To come to me forthwith.
To comfort Edward with our company.
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
To credit his own lie, he did believe
To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.
To cross me from the golden time I look for!
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
To curb the will of the nobility:
To cut off those that have offended him.
To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
To dash our late decree in parliament
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
To die for't!
To die upon the bed my father died,
To die when I desire.
To dim his glory and to stain the track
To disproportion me in every part,
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
To do him good?
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
To do me business in the veins o' the earth
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
To do that office of thine own good will
To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
To do what service am I sent for hither?
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
To draw him from his holy exercise.
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
To draw with idle spiders' strings
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
To drive away the heavy thought of care?
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
To ease his breast with panting.
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
To entreat your majesty to visit him.
To every article.
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
To excel the golden age.
To execute the charge my father gave me
To execute the like upon thyself;
To execute the noble duke at Calais.
To execution and the hand of death.
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
To extol what it hath done.
To fail in the disposing of those chances
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
To faithful service of your majesty.
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
To feed my innocent people.
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
To fight against that bloody homicide.
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
To fight with Glendower and his complices:
To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
To find this practise out.
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
To foreign passages, and in the end,
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
To free King Henry from imprisonment
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
To get slips of them.
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
To give my hand opposed against my heart
To give my poor host freedom.
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
To give thee all, and in his waning age
To give you over at this first encounter,
To give your censures in this weighty business?
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
To go along with us; for as we think,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
To go with us unto the officers.
To gratify his noble service that
To gratulate the gentle princes there.
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
To grim Necessity, and he and I
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To have a temple built you: all the swords
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To have her honour true than your suspicion,
To have her match'd: and having now provided
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
To have him match'd; and if you please to like
To have him suddenly convey'd away.
To have it added to the faults of mine,
To have my praise for this, perform a part
To have no screen between this part he play'd
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
To have some conference with your grace alone.
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
To have them recompensed as thought on.
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
To have you royally appointed as if
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
To hear Cominius speak?
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To hear my nothings monster'd.
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
To hear themselves remember'd.
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
To help Cominius.
To help King Edward in his time of storm,
To help him to his grave immediately!
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
To help me sort such needful ornaments
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
To her acceptance; you have let him go
To her allowing husband!
To her unhappy brother Claudio?
To her, Kate!
To her, widow!
To hide your doings; and to silence that,
To high promotions and great dignity:
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
To him had left it solely.
To him or our authorities. For an end,
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
To him, and to his substitutes.
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
To his most royal person, hither come
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
To hopeless restitution, so he might
To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
To imitate the graces of the gods;
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
To justify this worthy nobleman,
To keep him safely till his day of trial.
To keep that oath were more impiety
To keep the oath that we administer:
To keep them back that come to succor you:
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
To kill the king at Oxford.
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
To know, when two authorities are up,
To lay aside life-harming heaviness
To lay one in, another out to have.
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
To learn the order of my fingering,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
To let him slip at will.
To let him there a month behind the gest
To let me see them and to make me know
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
To lie close by his honest bones: but now
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
To lock up honesty and honour from
To look into the bottom of my place:
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
To look that way thou wert.
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
To make a false one.
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
To make a second fall of cursed man?
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
To make an act of tragic violence:
To make an envious mountain on my back,
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
To make confession and to be absolved.
To make die with a restorative.
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
To make her speak as move.
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
To make the perfect period of this peace.
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
To make thee consul.
To make this shameless callet know herself.
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
To me can life be no commodity:
To me for justice and rough chastisement;
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
To me or my swift passage, that I slide
To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
To meet anon, upon your approbation.
To meet at London London's king in woe.
To meet her new-beloved any where:
To meet me at the consecrated fount
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
To melt myself away in water-drops!
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
To mend her kissing with!
To merit bliss by making me despair:
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
To mine own children in good bringing up:
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
To more approved service and desert.
To most ignoble stooping.
To most that teach.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
To murder her I married.
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
To murder me?
To murder, murder our solemnity?
To my daughters; and tell them both,
To my house. Fare you well.
To my inheritance of free descent.
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
To nothing temporal.
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
To one that can my part in him advertise;
To one that would do thus. I am half through;
To one whom they had punish'd.
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
To pardon me yet for a night or two,
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
To pay their awful duty to our presence?
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
To play the broker in mine own behalf;
To please the king I did; to please myself
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
To pluck away their power, as now at last
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
To pluck on others.
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
To prattle for himself.
To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
To press before thy father to a grave?
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
To prove him, in defending of myself,
To prove it on thee to the extremest point
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
To purge herself with words: dispatch.
To put apart these your attendants, I
To put on better ere he go to church.
To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
To question of his apprehension.
To quicken your increase, I will beget
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
To raise my state to title of a queen,
To raze one title of your honour out:
To reach at victory above my head,
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
To revel it with him and his new bride.'
To revel it with him and his new bride:
To rid her from this second marriage,
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
To save me from the danger that might come
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
To save the innocent: any thing possible.
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
To save this brat's life?
To save this brother's life?
To save your life in this extremity,
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
To say you have seen a better.
To scarlet indignation and bedew
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
To search the secret treasons of the world:
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
To see a goodlier man.
To see alike mine honour as their profits,
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
To see her in your arms.
To see her noble lord restored to health,
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
To see his nobleness!
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
To see if any mean to shrink from me.
To see inherited my very wishes
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
To see my friends in Padua, but of all
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
To see these honours in possession.
To see this business. To-morrow next
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
To see thy son and heir more early down.
To see you are become so penitent.
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
To seek him here that means not to be found.
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
To seek their fortunes farther than at home
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
To serve me last, that I may longest keep
To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
To set him free from his captivity.
To set my brother Clarence and the king
To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
To show myself a glass.
To show the world I am a gentleman.
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
To shun the danger that his soul divines.
To signify thou camest to bite the world:
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
To sit about the coronation.
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
To some remote and desert place quite out
To speak before your time. Proceed.
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
To speak of peace or war.
To speak so indirectly I am loath:
To speak with Coriolanus.
To speak with you; may it please you to come down.
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
To spend the time to end it.
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
To stale 't a little more.
To stand upon my kingdom once again.
To stay him from the fall of vanity:
To stir against the butchers of his life!
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
To stop devoted charitable deeds?
To stop the inundation of her tears;
To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
To strew him o'er and o'er!
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
To study fashions to adorn my body:
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
To such abhorr'd pollution.
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
To sunder them that yoke so well together.
To supper; to our house.
To swear him in the justice of his cause.
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
To take advantage of the absent time
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
To take is not to give.
To take off so much grief from you as he
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
To take the one the other, by some chance,
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
To tell us whether they will come or no!
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
To the Capitol, come:
To the contrary I have express commandment.
To the corruption of a blemished stock:
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
To the end of reckoning.
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
To the fairness of my power.
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
To the ground, mistress.
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
To the most of men this is a Caliban
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
To the palace, an it like your worship.
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
To the people; not by your own instruction,
To the possession of thy royal hand:
To the pot, I warrant him.
To the rock, to the rock with him!
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
To the syllable.
To the under generation, you shall find
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
To them accordingly.
To think I can be undiscernible,
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
To think our former state a happy dream;
To think upon you.
To think your father, by some accident,
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--
To this same place, to this same monument.
To this submission. Yet I well remember
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
To this their late escape.
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
To three thousand dolours a year.
To thrust the lie unto him.
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
To tie thee to my strong correction.
To tire your royalty.
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
To trash for over-topping, new created
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
To try if thou be current gold indeed
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
To undeck the pompous body of a king;
To undercrest your good addition
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
To undertake the death of all the world,
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
To us that give you truly: by your patience,
To use it for my time: I am a brother
To use it like a giant.
To use my lawful sword!
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
To visit him to-morrow or next day:
To visit the next room, I'll presently
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
To wayward sickliness and age in him:
To weed my vice and let his grow!
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
To what we fear of death.
To what we wildly do, so we profess
To what, I pray?
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
To whom God will, there be the victory!
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
To whom I will retail my conquest won,
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
To whom my father is not all unknown;
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
To whom the heavens in thy nativity
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
To whom we all rest generally beholding.
To whom, my lord?
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
To win our daughter.
To win thy after-love I pardon thee.
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
To worthy danger and deserved death.
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
To yield what passes here.
To yield your voices?
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
To your high presence.
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
To your remembrances: but you have found,
To your worship's house, sir?
To, to, to--
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
To-morrow will I send.
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
To-morrow you set on.
To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
Together with the terror of the place,--
Together working with thy jealousies,
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
Told the sad story of my father's death,
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
Tongue-tied, our queen?
Too ceremonious and traditional
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Too familiar
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
Too far in years to be a pupil now:
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Too late he died that might have kept that title,
Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Too modest are you;
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
Too noble for this place.
Too proud to be so valiant.
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
Torment myself to catch the English crown:
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
Touching that point.
Touching the jointure that your king must make,
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Traitor! how now!
Traitors!
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
Tranio, since for the great desire I had
Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
True ornaments to know a holy man.
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
True! I'll be sworn they are true.
True! pow, wow.
True,
True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
True, I talk of dreams,
True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
True, noble prince.
True, so I am.
True, too true, my lord:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
True.
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
True; save means to live.
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
Tug for the time to come. This you may know
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
Turn then my freshest reputation to
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
Tush!
Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
Tush, I will stir about,
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
Tush, that was in thy rage:
Tush, thou art deceived:
Tush, tush!
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.
Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
Tut, fear not me.
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
Tut, that's a foolish observation:
Tut, tut!
Tut, tut,
Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Tutor:
Tutor:
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Twenty crowns!
Twenty crowns.
Twenty-three days
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
Twice being  
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
Two days ago. This jealousy
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Unbuckle, unbuckle.
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
Under Cominius.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
Under the canopy!
Under the canopy.
Under the colour of his usual game,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
Under what title shall I woo for thee,
Under whose colours he had fought so long.
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Under your good correction, I have seen,
Under your great command. You are to know
Under your sentence?
Uneven is the course, I like it not.
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
Unhappily, even so.
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
Unheard; what then?
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
Unknown to the beginning.
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
Unless another,
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
Unless he take the course that you have done,
Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
Unless the adage must be verified,
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
Unless you call it good to pity him,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
Unless you please to enter in the castle
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
Unless you will accompany me thither.
Unless, by not so doing, our good city
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
Until my husband bid me.
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
Until the duke take order for his burial:
Until the elder sister first be wed:
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
Until you see her die again; for then
Until your lordship came to see his death;
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Unto a lineal true-derived course.
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Unto his princely brother presently?
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
Unto my cell.
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
Unto our sister Bona.
Unto the appetite and affection common
Unto the brother of your loving bride;
Unto the citizens, who haply may
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
Unto the rigour of severest law.
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Unto these sorrows.
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
Up in my heart; which I have given already,
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
Up, sir, go with me;
Up.
Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
Upon a barren mountain and still winter
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Upon entreaty have a present aims;
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
Upon his bad life to make all this good,
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
Upon his own report and I believe it;
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
Upon his party for the gain thereof:
Upon his party.
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
Upon his visage, and that all the walls
Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Upon my body with their hellish charms?
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
Upon my faith and honour.
Upon my head and all this famous land.
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Upon my part shall be unviolable.
Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
Upon our territories; and have already
Upon record, my gracious lord.
Upon remainder of a dear account,
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
Upon the company you overtake?
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
Upon the heavy middle of the night
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.
Upon the stroke of four.
Upon the stroke of four.
Upon the stroke of ten.
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
Upon the water as he'll stand and read
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
Upon their ancient malice will forget
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.
Upon these slanderers.
Upon this ground; and more it would content me
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
Upon this present action.
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
Upon what cause?
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
Upon's again.
Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;

Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
Verily!
Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Verona, for a while I take my leave,
Very foul.
Very nobly
Very ready, sir.
Very sooth, to-morrow.
Very true, and but a month old.
Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
Very well met, and well come.
Very well.
Very well.
Very well:
Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
Very well; and could be content to give him good
Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
Villain, I'll make thee safe.
Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.

Virtue and that part of philosophy
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;

Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.

Visit his countrymen and banquet them?

Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
Warm and new kill'd.
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
Was I then to you!
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
Was ever book containing such vile matter
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
Was ever son so rued a father's death?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
Was his great ancestor.
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Was it not so?
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
Was like to be the best.
Was mutually committed?
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Was ne'er distributed.
Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Was never widow had so dear a loss!
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
Was not my lord
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
Was this the face that faced so many follies,
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
We are advertised by our loving friends
We are all frail.
We are all undone, unless
We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.
We are but plain fellows, sir.
We are convented
We are fit to bid her welcome.
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
We are to speak in public; for this business
We are tougher, brother,
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
We call a nettle but a nettle and
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
We can: my royal liege,
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
We cannot keep the town.
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
We cannot without circumstance descry.
We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
We charge you, that you have contrived to take
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
We could at once put us in readiness,
We did believe no less.
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
We do condemn thee to the very block
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
We do instate and widow you withal,
We do it not alone, sir.
We do request your kindest ears, and after,
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
We follow thee.
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
We had the tune on't a month ago.
We hate alike:
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
We have always truly served you, and beseech you
We have as many friends as enemies.
We have at disadvantage fought and did
We have been called so of many; not that our heads
We have been down together in my sleep,
We have compounded on.
We have deserved it.
We have ever your good word.
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
We have not yet been seen in any house,
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
We have record that very well it can,
We have some old crab-trees here
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
We have.
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
We honour you with trouble: but we came
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
We know your drift: speak what?
We know't, we know't.
We let the people know't.
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
We may digest our complots in some form.
We may live, son, to shed many more.
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
We may, sir, if we will.
We met here both to thank and to remember
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
We might recover all our loss again;
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
We must both give and take, my gracious lord.
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
We must proceed as we do find the people.
We must suggest the people in what hatred
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
We need no grave to bury honesty:
We need no more of your advice: the matter,
We need not put new matter to his charge:
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
We prove this very hour.
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
We set the axe to thy usurping root;
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
We shall be joyful of thy company.
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
We shall be short in our provision:
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
We shall proceed with Angelo.
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
We should by this, to all our lamentation,
We should infringe the holy privilege
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
We stay here for the people.
We still have known thee for a holy man.
We stood to't in good time.
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
We thank your honour.
We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
We three are married, but you two are sped.
We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
We tread upon, and never think of it.
We two have sworn shall come.
We two, my lord,
We wait upon your grace.
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
We were not born to sue, but to command;
We were, fair queen,
We will be there before the stream o' the people;
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
We will have rings and things and fine array;
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
We will meet them,
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
We will ourself in person to this war:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
We will so: almost all
We will unite the white rose and the red:
We will, my noble lord.
We would as willingly give cure as know.
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
We'll hear no more.
We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
We'll make an instrument of this, omit
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
We'll part the time between's then; and in that
We'll pass the business privately and well.
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
We'll surety him.
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
We, having now the best at Barnet field,
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
Weapons, weapons, weapons!
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Welcome father.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Welcome home, Grumio!
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Welcome, good Cambio.
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.
Welcome, how agreed?
Welcome, ladies, Welcome!
Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?
Welcome, my lord what is the news?
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
Welcome, then.
Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
Well aim'd of such a young one.
Well are you welcome to the open air.
Well begun, Tranio.
Well demanded, wench:
Well done, my lord.
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
Well said, Hermione.
Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Well said, noble woman?
Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
Well,
Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
Well, I do so.
Well, I have done: but yet,--
Well, I must do't:
Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Well, and say that Marcius
Well, be't so, prithee.
Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
Well, but what's o'clock?
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
Well, gentlemen,
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?
Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.
Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Well, go, prepare yourself.
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
Well, here he comes.
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
Well, let her be admitted.
Well, let it strike.
Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
Well, let us go together.
Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
Well, madam, and in health.
Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
Well, my lord,
Well, my lord.
Well, my lord.
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
Well, no more.
Well, on to the market-place.
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
Well, say. Peace, ho!
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
Well, sir.
Well, sir.
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
Well, then, farewell.
Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Well, we may meet again.
Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
Well, well, no more of that.
Well, well, no more.
Well, well, put up your sword.
Well, well, sir, well.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
Well, what then?
Well, what then? what then?
Well, what was yours?
Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!
Well; come to me to-morrow.
Well; the matter?
Well; what has he done?
Well; what's your suit?
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
Were I but where 'tis spoken.
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.
Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
Were damnable.
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Were equal poise of sin and charity.
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
Were feverous and did tremble.
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
Were he as famous and as bold in war
Were he more angry at it.
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Were he the veriest antic in the world.
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
Were in a mask?
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
Were it but told you, should be hooted at
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
Were most impertinent.
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
Were not revenge sufficient for me;
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Were slily crept into his human powers
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
Were there necessity in your request, although
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Were to incense the boar to follow us
Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
Were't not that, by great preservation,
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
Wert thou the Hector
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
What 'unjust'!
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
What I have written to you?
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
What a blow was there given!
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
What a pestilent knave is this same!
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
What advocate hast thou to him?
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
What answer shall I make to this base man?
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
What are they that fly there?
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
What are you, sir?
What are you?
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
What became of his bark and his followers?
What black magician conjures up this fiend,
What but to speak of would offend again.
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
What cannot be amended.
What cannot be, slight work.
What canst thou swear by now?
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
What colour are your eyebrows?
What colour for my visitation shall I
What comfort is for Claudio?
What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
What could the belly answer?
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?
What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
What countryman, I pray?
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
What do ye talk?
What do you prate of service?
What do you think?
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
What dost thou then in prison?
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
What else?
What else? and that succession be determined.
What ever have been thought on in this state,
What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
What faults he made before the last, I think
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
What fellow's this?
What figure of us think you he will bear?
What fit is this, good lady?
What follows this?
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
What further woe conspires against mine age?
What good condition can a treaty find
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
What good is this to England and himself!
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
What hast here? ballads?
What hast thou found?
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
What heir of York is there alive but we?
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
What if it be a poison, which the friar
What if this mixture do not work at all?
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
What is about to be? I am out of breath;
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
What is become of Marcius?
What is granted them?
What is he, Biondello?
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
What is her mother?

What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
What is it?

What is she but a foul contending rebel
What is six winters? they are quickly gone.
What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
What is the body when the head is off?
What is the business?
What is the city but the people?
What is the jay more precious than the lark,
What is the matter
What is the matter with our cousin now?

What is thy news then?

What is your crest? a coxcomb?
What is your quarrel? how began it first?
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
What is your will?

What man thou art.
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:

What said our cousin when you parted with him?

What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

What you do
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
What you have done--before our army hear me.
What you have nobly done.
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
What you must say; that he shall not perceive
What you profess.
What you will have it named, even that it is;
What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;

What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
What! lack I credit?
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
What! threat you me with telling of the king?
What! was it you that would be England's king?
What! we have many goodly days to see:
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
What's he that now is going out of door?
What's he?
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
What's o'clock, think you?
What's that to thee?
What's that, I pray?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the news?
What's the news? what's the news?
What's there?
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
What's this? mutton?
What's this? what's this?
What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.
What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
What's your will, father
What, Grumio!
What, I prithee, might be the cause?
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?

What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
What, art thou hurt?
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
What, art thou waking?
What, by a horseman, or a footman?
What, canst not rule her?
What, did he marry me to famish me?
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
What, go you toward the Tower?
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
What, had he so?
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
What, have I choked you with an argosy?
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?
What, ho! apothecary!
What, ho! my lord!
What, ho, Barnardine!
What, household stuff?
What, in metre?
What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
What, in the midst of the street?
What, is he in his bed?
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
What, is the man lunatic?
What, is there a maid with child by him?
What, is't murder?
What, like a corse?
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
What, marry, may she?
What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
What, must our mouths be cold?
What, my gracious lord?
What, my lord?
What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
What, neither?
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
What, sovereign sir,
What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
What, think you then the king shall be deposed?
What, thou?
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
What, was I born to this, that my sad look
What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
What, what, what!
What, what, what? let's partake.
What, what? his choler?
What, will he come?
What, will he not to bed?
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
What, with five thousand men?
What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
What, you mean my face?
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
What?
What?
What? I say,
What? what?
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
When I am cold in zeal to yours.
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
When I do see the very book indeed
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
When I have most need to employ a friend,
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
When I return with victory from the field
When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
When I should mount with wings of victory:
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
When I was last in Holborn,
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
When I would pray and think, I think and pray
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.
When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
When daffodils begin to peer,
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
When he did need your loves, and do you think
When he did stand for consul, which he lost
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
When he might act the woman in the scene,
When he might spurn him with his foot away?
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
When he stands where I am and sees you there.
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
When holy and devout religious men
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
When it hoars ere it be spent.
When it is baked with frost.
When it is least expected.
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
When it was less expected: he replied,
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
When men are unprepared and look not for it.
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
When most the truth; which I receive much better
When must he die?
When my good falcon made her flight across
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
When nature brought him to the door of death?
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
When once she is my wife.
When one but of my ordinance stood up
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
When presently through all thy veins shall run
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
When she will play with reason and discourse,
When she will take the rein I let her run;
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
When such a sacred king should hide his head.
When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
When the devout religion of mine eye
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
When the tongue's office should be prodigal
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
When this is known, then to divide the times:
When thou comest thither--
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
When time is broke and no proportion kept!
When time shall call him home from banishment,
When triumph is become an alehouse guest?
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
When we shall hap to give 't them.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
When weeping made you break the story off,
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
When will he be here?
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
When you are cloudy.
When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
When you cast out, it still came home.
When you curse them as enemies.
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
When you disgraced me in my embassade,
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
When you should bring the plaster.
When, Harry, when?
When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
When, after execution, judgment hath
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Whene'er we come to our account.
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
Where and what time your majesty shall please.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
Where did I leave?
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
Where dwellest thou?
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
Where he abides.
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Where he was to begin and give away
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
Where is Lucentio?
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
Where is he wounded?
Where is he, hear you?
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where is he? call him hither.
Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
Where is my wife?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
Where is that slave
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Where is the duke my father with his power?
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
Where is the king?
Where is the life that late I led--
Where is the master, boatswain?
Where is the post that came from Montague?
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
Where is the provost?
Where is this fellow?
Where is this viper
Where is thy conscience now?
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where is your ancient courage? you were used
Where is your mother?'
Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
Where it fits not you to know.
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
Where left we last?
Where lies he?
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.
Where no man never comes but that sad dog
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
Where of the execution did cry out
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Where our right valiant father is become.
Where peremptory Warwick now remains:
Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
Where should be graven, if that right were right,
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
Where sits deformity to mock my body;
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Where the warlike Smalus,
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
Where they shall know our mind: away!
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
Where were you born, friend?
Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
Where you shall find me well accompanied
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,
Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.
Where's Bohemia? speak.
Where's Caius Marcius?
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
Where's Cotus? my master calls
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
Where's Richard gone?
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
Where's that?
Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
Where? at the senate-house?
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
Whereby my son is disinherited.
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
Wherefore did they not
Wherefore that box?
Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Wherefore? wherefore?
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
Which God defend a knight should violate!--
Which God defend that I should wring from him!
Which God revenge!
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
Which I can scarcely bear.
Which I could fancy more than any other.
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
Which I protest against--I am assisted
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
Which I'll lay down.
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Which art a lion and a king of beasts?
Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
Which being shallow, you give me leave
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
Which breathed this poison.
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
Which by my presence might have been concluded.
Which by the interpretation of full time
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
Which contradicts my accusation and
Which craves as desperate an execution.
Which dances with your daughter?
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
Which draught to me were cordial.
Which easily endures not article
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
Which else would post until it had return'd
Which else would put you to your fortune and
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
Which false hope lingers in extremity.
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Which haply by much company might be urged:
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
Which he counts but a trifle.
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
Which he has put upon't!
Which he not dreams of.
Which he so sets at nought.
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
Which here we waken to our country's good,
Which here you come to accuse.
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining

Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
Which in myself I boldly will defend;
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
Which in the time of death he gave our father.
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
Which in your outward actions shows itself
Which industry and courage might have saved?
Which is as thin of substance as the air
Which is for me less easy to commit
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
Which is his house, beseech you?
Which is not yet perform'd me.
Which is that Barnardine?
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Which is the least?
Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
Which issued from my other angel husband
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
Which live like venom where no venom else
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
Which men are best inclined.
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
Which never tender lady hath born greater,
Which never were nor no man ever saw.
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
Which now came from him.
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Which on more view, of many mine being one
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
Which on thy royal party granted once,
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
Which our divines lose by 'em.
Which our profane hours here have stricken down.
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
Which runs himself and catches for his master.
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Which she hath praised him with above compare
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
Which the commission of thy years and art
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
Which the rather
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
Which then will speak, that you must
Which they have given to beggars.
Which they have often made against the senate,
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Which to recure, we heartily solicit
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
Which was sometime his general; who loved him
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
Which way to be prevented, if to be;
Which we devise him.
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
Which we have goaded onward.
Which we have noted in you to your kin,
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
Which we will second. When he lies along,
Which well I am assured I have not done,
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
Which would be so much the more dangerous
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
Which you say adds to nature, is an art
Which you weep for.
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
Which, like unruly children, make their sire
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
While I make way from hence to save my life:
While I myself will lead a private life
While I remain above the ground, you shall
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
While I use further conference with Warwick.
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
While he himself keeps in the cold field?
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
While she did call me rascal fiddler
While we bethink a means to break it off.
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
While we lie tumbling in the hay.
While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
While we return these dukes what we decree.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
Whiles thou art waking.
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
Whilst I remember
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
Whither?
Whither?
Whither?
Whither?
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
Who am prepared against your territories,
Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
Who are they that complain unto the king,
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
Who brought it?
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
Who by his prowess conquered all France:
Who calls so loud?
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Who can do good on him?
Who comes with him?
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
Who deserves greatness
Who did hoot him out o' the city.
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
Who does infect her?
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
Who goes there?
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
Who hath committed them?
Who hath descried the number of the foe?
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Who have we here?
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Who hither come engaged by my oath--
Who in rebellion with himself will have
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
Who intercepts my expedition?
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
Who is it?
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
Who is most inward with the royal duke?
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
Who is so far from Italy removed
Who is that calls so coldly?
Who is the sink o' the body,--
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
Who knows not that?
Who knows not where a wasp does
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
Who loves another best.
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
Who saw the sun to-day?
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
Who shall ask it?
Who shall begin?
Who shall hinder me?
Who shall reward you better for my life
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
Who should succeed the father but the son?
Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
Who taught you this?
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
Who thrives and who declines; side factions
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Who was the model of thy father's life.
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Who will believe thee, Isabel?
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
Who's that which calls?
Who's that, I pray thee?
Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
Who's yonder,
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
Who, earnest in the service of my God,
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Who, my master?
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
Who? Camillo?
Who? that Petruchio came?
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Whom late you have named for consul.
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
Whom should he follow but his natural king?
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
Whom we have left protectors of the king,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Whose duty is deceiveable and false.
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
Whose father bears the title of a king,--
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
Whose father slew my father, he shall die.
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Whose house?
Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
Whose tongue?
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
Why
Why 'Heart's ease?'
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?
Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
Why do you put these sayings upon me?
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
Why dost thou ask again?
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
Why dost thou spit at me?
Why dost thou stay?
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Why force you this?
Why give you me this shame?
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
Why let it strike?
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
Why look you so upon me?
Why looks your grace so heavily today?
Why or for what these nobles were committed
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
Why should I not now have the like success?
Why should calamity be full of words?
Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,
Why should he die, sir?
Why should she live, to fill the world with words?
Why should we in the compass of a pale
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
Why should you sigh, my lord?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
Why stay we to be baited
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Why that way?
Why that's my spirit!
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Why then, by God--
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
Why then, the mustard without the beef.
Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.
Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
Why will you mew her up,
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
Why would he for the momentary trick
Why,
Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
Why, Clarence, to myself.
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
Why, I pray you?
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Why, York, what wilt thou do?
Why, a horse.
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?
Why, boy, how is it?
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
Why, how are we censured?
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
Why, how now, Juliet!
Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
Why, how now, father!
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
Why, in good time.
Why, is he not with the queen?
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
Why, it contains no king?
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Why, knows not Montague that of itself
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
Why, may one ask?
Why, my sweet lord?
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
Why, no, sir.
Why, no.
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
Why, noble lords,
Why, our battalion trebles that account:
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
Why, shall the people give
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
Why, she hath a face of her own.
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
Why, sir, he comes not.
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
Why, sir?
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
Why, so he did, I am sure.
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
Why, so: you have made good work!
Why, such is love's transgression.
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
Why, that was he.
Why, that was when
Why, that's all one.
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
Why, then he is alive.
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
Why, then they are not dead:
Why, then thou art an executioner.
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:
Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
Why, they stay at door, sir.
Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
Why, this was known before.
Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
Why, uncle, what's the matter?
Why, very well, then,--
Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
Why, what is Tybalt?
Why, what is it, my lord?
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
Why, what need we
Why, what of that?
Why, what should you fear?
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
Why, what's a moveable?
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
Why?
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.
Widow, we will consider of your suit;
Widow:
Widow:
Widow:
Widow:
Widow:
Widow:
Widow:
Widow:
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Will I apply that treats of happiness
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Will I live?
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
Will answer in mine honour.
Will apprehend you as his enemy.
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
Will bring me to consider that which may
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
Will but remember me what a deal of world
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Will issue out again and bid us battle:
Will it not be?
Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
Will maintain it with some little cost.
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
Will never do him good, not one of you.
Will no more hear from thence.
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
Will not have earth to know.
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
Will not you go?
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
Will or exceed the common or be caught
Will piece up in himself.
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
Will raise us all.
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
Will serve the turn.
Will so your accusation overweigh,
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Will well become the seat of majesty,
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
Will you be gone?
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
Will you buy any tape,
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
Will you go along with us?
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
Will you swear
Will you take eggs for money?
Will you tell me that?
Will you undo yourselves?
Will you we show our title to the crown?
Will't not off?
Will't please you walk aside?
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Wine, wine, wine! What service
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
Wise! why, no question but he was.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Wish we all joy and honour.
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
With Angelo to-night shall lie
With Cain go wander through shades of night,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
With a sweet fellow to't?
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
With all my heart
With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
With all our harts.
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
With all swift speed you must away to France.
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
With all the applause and clamour of the host,
With all the effect of love.
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
With all the gracious utterance thou hast
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
With all the rest of that consorted crew,
With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.
With all your just proceedings in this cause.
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
With an eye of green in't.
With any but with us.
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
With being nothing. Music do I hear?
With best advantage will deceive the time,
With blood removed but little from her own?
With bloody passage led your wars even to
With bootless labour swim against the tide
With cautelous baits and practise.
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
With child, perhaps?
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
With cloth of any colour.
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
With customary compliment; when he,
With daily prayers all to that effect.
With divers deaths in death.
With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
With every minute you do change a mind,
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
With flowers of winter.
With fury from his native residence.
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
With giving him glory.
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
With great creating nature.
With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
With hate in those where I expect most love!
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
With her companion grief must end her life.
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
With his good will and thy good company,
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
With his unkindness? say't be so?
With honour, as in war, since that to both
With honours like himself.
With humble and familiar courtesy,
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
With instruments upon them, fit to open
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
With less respect than we do minister
With letters of your love to her at large.
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
With manacles thorough our streets, or else
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
With many more confederates, are in arms.
With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
With mine own hands I give away my crown,
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
With modest warrant.
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
With much ado at length have gotten leave
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
With no less honour to the Antiates
With no less terror than the elements
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
With old Menenius, and those senators
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With one that wants her wits?
With only suffering stain by him; for him
With open outcry toward our monument.
With other muniments and petty helps
With our own charge, making a treaty where
With painted imagery had said at once
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
With politic grave counsel; then the king
With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
With precepts that would make invincible
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
With promise of high pay and great rewards:
With promise of his sister, and what else,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
With rival-hating envy, set on you
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
With scruples and do set the word itself
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
With signs of war about his aged neck:
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
With some few private friends upon this coast.
With some men else, who think themselves as safe
With speedy help doth lend redress.'
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
With striving less to be so; lesser had been
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
With such a kind of love as might become
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
With that which, but by being so retired,
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
With the least cause these his new honours, which
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
With thee awhile: determine on some course,
With their refusal, both observe and answer
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
With them forgive yourself.
With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
With this dead-killing news!
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
With this night's revels and expire the term
With this young prince.
With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
With too much riches it confound itself:
With too much urging your pernicious lives,
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
With unrestrained loose companions,
With us to break his neck.
With variable complexions, all agreeing
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
With what his valour did enrich his wit,
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
With whom I am accused, I do confess
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
With words of sooth! O that I were as great
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
Withdraw yourselves.
Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
Within their innocent alabaster arms:
Within these three hours, Tullus,
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
Within this mile and half.
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
Within two hours.
Within whose circuit is Elysium
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Without a burthen: time as long again
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Without assistance.
Without control, listed to make his prey.
Without her love; for her employ them all;
Without her, follows to this land and me,
Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
Without more mercy, to its own protection
Without more overture.
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
Without suspicion.
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
Woe me! for what?
Woe the while!
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
Women and children of so high a courage,
Women are made to bear, and so are you.
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
Women will love her, that she is a woman
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
Work you then.
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Worse than a promise-breaker.
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
Worth six on him.
Worthy Camillo,
Worthy Cominius, speak.
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
Worthy man!
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Worthy tribunes,
Worthy voices!
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
Would God that any in this noble presence
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
Would I might
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Would Katharina had never seen him though!
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
Would all themselves laugh mortal.
Would all were well! but that will never be
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
Would be unparallel'd.
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
Would blow you through and through.
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
Would buy this for a lie!
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
Would have him wed again.
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
Would long ere this have met us on the way
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
Would not entreat for life?
Would not have been so stern.
Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:
Would not infect his reason?
Would not the beggar then forget himself?
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
Would they else be content to die?
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
Would think upon you for your voices and
Would through the airy region stream so bright
Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Would you have been so brief with him, he would
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
Wrench up thy power to the highest.
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
Write up his title with usurping blood.
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
Ye re goodly things, you voices!
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.
Ye shall, my Lord.
Ye're long about it.
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
Yea, are you so brief?
Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
Yea, his dread trident shake.
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.
Yea, my good lord.
Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
Yea, say you so?
Yea, scandalous to the world.
Yea.
Yes, Caliban her son.
Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
Yes, an't please you, sir.
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
Yes, better, sir.
Yes, brother, you may live:
Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
Yes, faith, sir.
Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
Yes, if you will, my lord.
Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
Yes, my good lord,
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
Yes, worthy sir,
Yes. Has he affections in him,
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
Yes; keep you warm.
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Yet I wish, sir,--
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
Yet ask.
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
Yet did repent me, after more advice;
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
Yet give leave, my lord,
Yet had not we determined he should die,
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
Yet he is come.
Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
Yet he would be king on't.
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
Yet let us all together to our troops,
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Yet nature is made better by no mean
Yet nature might have made me as these are,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
Yet one time he did call me by my name:
Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
Yet show some pity.
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
Yet you are wither'd.
Yet your good will
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
Yet,--
Yet,--
Yield not thy neck
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
Yield, Marcius, yield!
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
Yields us kind answer.
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
Yond crickets shall not hear it.
Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
Yonder man is carried to prison.
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
You are a Roman, are you?
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
You are abused and by some putter-on
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
You are at point to lose your liberties:
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.
You are like to do such business.
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
You are looked for and called for, asked for and
You are married?
You are most welcome home.
You are my father, for methinks in you
You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
You are one of those
You are pardon'd, Isabel:
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
You are sent for to the senate:
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
You are too absolute;
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
You are too hot.
You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
You are transported by calamity
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
You are welcome all.
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
You are welcome, sir.
You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
You bid me make it orderly and well,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
You bless me, gods!
You break into some merry passion
You break no privilege nor charter there.
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
You cram these words into mine ears against
You cry against the noble senate, who,
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
You did mistake.
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
You do but lose your labour.
You do him injury to scorn his corse.
You do him wrong, surely.
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
You do the nobler.
You envy my advancement and my friends':
You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
You find him like a soldier: do not take
You gods, look down
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
You had not found me here so musical:
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
You have a father able to maintain you;
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
You have been factious one against the other,
You have brought
You have but jested with me all this while:
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
You have fought together.
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
You have in manner with your sinful hours
You have made
You have made fair work!
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
You have made good work,
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
You have mistook, my lady,
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
You have no cause.
You have no children, butchers! if you had,
You have not been inquired after:
You have not dared to break the holy seal
You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
You have often
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
You have paid the heavens your function, and the
You have put me now to such a part which never
You have received many wounds for your country.
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
You have said you will not grant us any thing;
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
You have told them home;
You have tripp'd since.
You have undone a man of fourscore three,
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
You holy clergymen, is there no plot
You keep a constant temper.
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
You kiss by the book.
You knew my father well, and in him me,
You knew of his departure, as you know
You know him not, sir.
You know me, do you not?
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
You know the very road into his kindness,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
You know your father's temper: at this time
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
You lie.
You live that shall cry woe for this after.
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
You love the breeder better than the male.
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.
You make my bonds still greater.
You make strong party, or defend yourself
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
You may deny that you were not the cause
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
You may my glories and my state depose,
You may not pass, you must return: our general
You may not so extenuate his offence
You may partake of any thing we say:
You may say it, but not swear it.
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
You may, sir.
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
You might have been enough the man you are,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
You must lay down the treasures of your body
You must not enter.
You must not speak of that: you must desire them
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
You must return and mend it.
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
You must walk by us on our other hand;
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
You need not fear it, sir:
You never shall, so help you truth and God!
You never spoke what did become you less
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
You peers, continue this united league:
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
You precious winners all; your exultation
You promised knighthood to our forward son:
You promised, when you parted with the king,
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
You said so much before, and yet you fled.
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
You say that Edward is your brother's son:
You say well.
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
You see how he intends to use the people.
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
You shall go see your pupils presently.
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
You shall have aid.
You shall have letters from me to my son
You shall have me assisting you in all.
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
You shall hear more ere morning.
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
You shall not be
You shall not be admitted to his sight.
You shall not choose but drink before you go:
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
You shall not only take the sacrament
You shall, my lord.
You shall.
You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
You shout me forth
You show too much of that
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
You smell this business with a sense as cold
You so remain.
You something know; yet I believe there comes
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
You speak a language that I understand not:
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
You speak o' the people,
You speak too bitterly.
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
You take it off again?
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
You tallow-face!
You taught me language; and my profit on't
You tempt him over-much.
You that be noble; help him, young and old!
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
You that have been so tenderly officious
You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
You that will follow me to this attempt,
You thus employ'd, I will go root away
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
You understand me: over and beside
You understand me?
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
You were a moveable.
You were conducted to a gentle bath
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
You were not bid to speak.
You were pretty lordings then?
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
You will be schoolmaster
You will be there, I know.
You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
You will demand of me why I do this?
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
You will not bail me, then, sir?
You will not own it.
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
You will not, then?
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
You woo'd me the false way.
You worthy tribunes,--
You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
You would have bid me argue like a father.
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
You would have thought the very windows spake,
You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
You'ld call your children yours.
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You'll mar all:
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
You're liars all.
You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
You're welcome: what's your will?
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
You, my lords,
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
You, the great toe of this assembly?
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
You?
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
Young MARCIUS:
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
Young Romeo is it?
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
Your Coriolanus
Your Rome about your ears.
Your actions are my dreams;
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
Your bed-chamber.
Your belly's answer? What!
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
Your brother is to die.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Your children were vexation to your youth,
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
Your children's children quit it in your age.
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
Your colder reasons.
Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
Your crown content and you must be contented
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
Your enemies and his find something in him.
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Your enigma?
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
Your father's image is so hit in you,
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Your fellow tribune.
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
Your grace may do your pleasure.
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Your guest, then, madam:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
Your heaviest censure.
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
Your highness to assign our trial day.
Your highness told me I should post before.
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
Your honour with your form.
Your honour's players, heating your amendment,
Your horror's pardon:
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
Your joys with like relation. Go together,
Your kindness better.
Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
Your knee, sirrah.
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
Your lady's love against some other maid
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
Your legs did better service than your hands.
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
Your loving motion toward the common body,
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
Your mistress' name?
Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.
Your mother.
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
Your native town you enter'd like a post,
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
Your only choice.
Your own desert!
Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
Your pardon, sir; for this
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
Your princely father and my loving lord!
Your provost knows the place where he abides
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Your right depends not on his life or death.
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
Your sad tires in a mile-a.
Your safety manifested.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Your sudden approbation.
Your sued-for tongues?
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Your tributary drops belong to woe,

Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
